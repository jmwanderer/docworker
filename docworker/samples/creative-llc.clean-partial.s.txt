ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 
APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT  
[June 30, 2023] 
JUSTICE GORSUCH  delivered the opinion of the Court. 
  Like many States, Colorado has a law forbidding businesses  from  engaging  in  discrimination  when  they  sell 
goods and services to the public.  Laws along these lines 
have done much to secure the civil rights of all Americans.  
But in this particular case Colorado does not just seek to 
ensure the sale of goods or services on equal terms.  It seeks 
to use its law to compel an individual to create speech she 
does not believe.  The question we face is whether that  
course violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.  
I 
A 
  Through her business, 303 Creative LLC, Lorie Smith offers website and graphic design, marketing advice, and social media management services.  Recently, she decided to 
expand her offerings to include services for couples seeking 
websites for their weddings.  As she envisions it, her websites will provide couples with text, graphic arts, and videos 
to “celebrate” and “conve[y]” the “details” of their “unique love story.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a, 187a, 198a.  The

Opinion of the Court 
websites will discuss how the couple met, explain their 
backgrounds, families, and future plans, and provide information about their upcoming wedding.  All of the text and 
graphics on these websites will be “original,” “customized,” 
and “tailored” creations.  Id., at 187a.  The websites will be 
“expressive in nature,” designed “to communicate a particular message.”  Id., at 181a.  Viewers will know, too, “that  
the websites are [Ms. Smith’s] original artwork,” for the 
name of the company she owns and operates by herself will 
be displayed on every one.  Id., at 187a. 
  While Ms. Smith has laid the groundwork for her new 
venture, she has yet to carry out her plans.  She worries  
that, if she does so, Colorado will force her to express views 
with which she disagrees.  Ms. Smith provides her website 
and graphic services to customers regardless of their race, 
creed, sex, or sexual orientation.  Id., at 184a.  But she has  
never created expressions that contradict her own views for 
anyone—whether that means generating works that encourage violence, demean another person, or defy her religious beliefs by, say, promoting atheism. See ibid.;  see also  
Tr. of Oral Arg. 19–20.  Ms. Smith does not wish to do otherwise now, but she worries Colorado has different plans.  
Specifically, she worries that, if she enters the wedding 
website business, the State will force her to convey messages inconsistent with her belief that marriage should be 
reserved to unions between one man and one woman.  App. 
to Pet. for Cert. 177a–190a.  Ms.  Smith acknowledges that 
her views about marriage may not be popular in all quarters.  But, she asserts, the First Amendment’s Free Speech 
Clause protects her from being compelled to speak what she 
does not believe.  The Constitution, she insists, protects her 
right to differ. 
B 
  To clarify her rights, Ms. Smith filed a lawsuit in federal 
 
  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  3 
 
Opinion of the Court 
district court.  In that suit, she sought an injunction to prevent the State from forcing her to create wedding websites 
celebrating marriages that defy her beliefs.  App. 303–305.  
To secure relief, Ms. Smith first had to establish her standing to sue.  That required her to show “a credible threat” 
existed that Colorado would, in fact, seek to compel speech 
from her that she did not wish to produce.  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U. S. 149, 159 (2014). 
  Toward that end, Ms. Smith began by directing the court 
to the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA).  That law 
defines a “public accommodation” broadly to include almost
every public-facing business in the State.  Colo. Rev. Stat.  
§24–34–601(1) (2022).  In what some call its “Accommodation Clause,” the law prohibits a public accommodation 
from denying “the full and equal enjoyment” of its goods and 
services to any customer based on his race, creed, disability, 
sexual orientation, or other statutorily enumerated trait.   
§24–34–601(2)(a).  Either state officials or private citizens 
may bring actions to enforce the law.  §§24–34–306, 24–34–602(1).  And a variety of penalties can follow.  Courts can 
order fines up to $500 per violation. §24–34–602(1)(a). The 
Colorado Commission on Civil Rights can issue cease-and-desist orders, §24–34–306(9), and require violators to take 
various other “affirmative action[s].” §24–34–605; §24–34–306(9).  In  the past, these have included participation in 
mandatory educational programs and the submission of ongoing compliance reports to state officials.  See Masterpiece  
Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Comm’n, 584 U.  S.  
___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 8).1  
—————— 
1In addition to the Accommodation Clause, CADA contains a “Communication Clause” that prohibits a public accommodation from “publish[ing] .  .  . any written . .  . communication” indicating that a person will 
be denied “the full and equal enjoyment” of services or that he will be 
“unwelcome, objectionable, unacceptable, or undesirable” based on a pro-

Opinion of the Court 
  In her lawsuit, Ms. Smith alleged that, if she enters the 
wedding website business to celebrate marriages she does 
endorse, she faces a credible threat that Colorado will seek 
to use CADA to compel her to create websites celebrating 
marriages she does not endorse.  6 F. 4th 1160, 1173–1174  
(CA10 2021).  As evidence, Ms. Smith pointed to Colorado’s 
record of past enforcement actions under CADA, including 
one that worked its way to this Court five years ago.  See 
Masterpiece Cakeshop, 584 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9); see 
also App. 25–155 (discussing Colorado’s other past enforcement actions).
  To facilitate the district court’s resolution of the merits of 
her case, Ms. Smith and the State stipulated to a number 
of facts: 
    Ms. Smith is “willing to work with all people regardless of classifications such as race, creed, sexual orientation, and gender,” and she “will gladly create 
custom graphics and websites” for clients of any sexual orientation.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a. 
    She will not produce content that “contradicts biblical truth” regardless of who orders it.  Ibid.  
    Her belief that marriage is a union between one man 
and one woman is a sincerely held religious conviction.  Id., at 179a. 
    All of the graphic and website design services Ms. 
Smith provides are “expressive.”  Id., at 181a. 
    The websites and graphics Ms. Smith designs are
“original, customized” creations that “contribut[e] to 
the overall messages” her business conveys “through 
the websites” it creates.  Id., at 181a–182a. 
—————— 
tected classification.  Colo. Rev. Stat. §24–34–601(2)(a) (2022).  The Communication Clause, Ms. Smith notes, prohibits any speech inconsistent  
with the Accommodation Clause.  Because Colorado concedes that its authority to apply the Communication Clause to Ms. Smith stands or falls 
with its authority to apply the Accommodation Clause, see Brief for Respondents 44–45, we focus our attention on the Accommodation Clause.

Opinion of the Court 
    Just like the other services she provides, the wedding websites Ms. Smith plans to create “will be expressive in nature.”  Id., at 187a. 
    Those wedding websites will be “customized and tailored” through close collaboration with individual 
couples, and they will “express Ms. Smith’s and 303 
Creative’s message celebrating and promoting” her 
view of marriage.  Id., at 186a–187a. 
    Viewers of Ms. Smith’s websites “will know that the  
websites are [Ms. Smith’s and 303 Creative’s] original artwork.”  Id., at 187a. 
    To the extent Ms. Smith may not be able to provide
certain services to a potential customer, “[t]here are 
numerous companies in the State of Colorado and 
across the nation that offer custom website design 
services.”  Id., at 190a. 
C 
  Ultimately, the district court ruled against Ms. Smith.  
405 F. Supp. 3d 907, 912 (Colo. 2019).  So did the Tenth 
Circuit.  6 F. 4th, at 1168.  For its part, the Tenth Circuit
held that Ms. Smith had standing to sue.  In that court’s  
judgment, she had established a credible threat that, if she 
follows through on her plans to offer wedding  website services, Colorado will invoke CADA to force her to create 
speech she does not believe or endorse.  Id., at 1172–1175.   
The court pointed to the fact that “Colorado has a history of 
past  enforcement  against  nearly  identical  conduct—i.e.,  
Masterpiece Cakeshop”; that anyone in the State may file a 
complaint against Ms. Smith and initiate “a potentially 
burdensome  administrative  hearing”  process;  and  that 
“Colorado [has] decline[d] to disavow future enforcement” 
proceedings against her.  Id., at 1174.  Before us, no party
challenges these conclusions. 
  Turning to the merits, however, the Tenth Circuit held 
that  Ms.  Smith  was  not  entitled  to  the  injunction  she 
 
6  303 CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS  
   
Opinion of the Court 
sought.  The court acknowledged that Ms. Smith’s planned 
wedding websites qualify as “pure speech” protected by the 
First Amendment.  Id., at 1176.  As a result, the court reasoned, Colorado had to satisfy “strict scrutiny” before compelling speech from her that she did not wish to create.  Id.,  
at 1178.  Under that standard, the court continued, the  
State had to show both that forcing Ms. Smith to create 
speech would serve a compelling governmental interest and 
that no less restrictive alternative exists to secure that interest. Ibid. Ultimately, a divided panel concluded that the 
State had carried these burdens.  As the majority saw it, 
Colorado has a compelling interest in ensuring “equal access to publicly available goods and services,” and no option 
short of coercing speech from Ms. Smith can satisfy that interest because she plans to offer “unique services” that are, 
“by definition, unavailable elsewhere.”  Id., at 1179–1180  
(internal quotation marks omitted).
  Chief Judge Tymkovich dissented.  He observed that “ensuring access to a particular person’s” voice, expression, or 
artistic talent has never qualified as “a compelling state interest” under this Court’s precedents. Id., at 1203.  Nor, he  
submitted, should courts depart from those precedents now.  
“Taken to its logical end,” Chief Judge Tymkovich warned, 
his colleagues’ approach would permit the government to 
“regulate the messages communicated by all artists”—a result he called “unprecedented.”  Id., at 1204.  
  We granted certiorari to review the Tenth Circuit’s disposition.  595 U. S. ___ (2022).  
II  
  The framers designed the Free Speech Clause of the First 
Amendment to protect the “freedom to think as you will and 
to speak as you think.”  Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530  
U. S. 640, 660–661 (2000) (internal quotation  marks omitted).  They did so because they saw the freedom of speech 
“both as an end and as a means.”  Whitney v. California, 
 
  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  7 
 
Opinion of the Court 
274 U. S. 357, 375 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring); see also 
12 The Papers of James Madison 193–194 (C. Hobson & R. 
Rutland eds. 1979).  An end because the freedom to think 
and speak is among our inalienable human rights.  See, e.g., 
4 Annals of Cong. 934 (1794) (Rep. Madison).  A means because the freedom of thought and speech is “indispensable 
to the discovery and spread of political truth.”  Whitney, 274 
U. S., at 375 (Brandeis, J., concurring).  By allowing all
views to flourish, the framers understood, we may test and 
improve our own thinking both as individuals and as a Nation.  For all these reasons, “[i]f there is any fixed star in 
our constitutional constellation,” West Virginia Bd. of Ed.  
v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943), it is the principle that 
the government may not interfere with “an uninhibited  
marketplace of ideas,” McCullen v.  Coakley, 573 U. S. 464,  
476 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).
  From time to time, governments in this country have 
sought to test these foundational principles.  In Barnette, 
for example, the Court faced an effort by the State of West 
Virginia to force schoolchildren to salute the Nation’s flag 
and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. If the students refused, 
the State threatened to expel them and fine or jail their parents.  Some families objected on the ground that the State 
sought to compel their children to express views at odds 
with their faith as Jehovah’s Witnesses.  When the dispute 
arrived here, this Court offered a firm response.  In seeking 
to compel students to salute the flag and recite a pledge, the 
Court held, state authorities had “transcend[ed] constitutional limitations on their powers.”  319 U. S.,  at 642.  Their 
dictates “invade[d] the sphere of intellect and spirit which 
it is the purpose of the First Amendment . . . to reserve from 
all official control.”  Ibid.  
  A similar story unfolded in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay,  
Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557 
(1995).  There, veterans organizing a St. Patrick’s Day parade in Boston refused to include a group of gay, lesbian,  
 
8  303 CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS  
   
Opinion of the Court 
and bisexual individuals in their event.  The group argued 
that Massachusetts’s public accommodations statute entitled it to participate in the parade as a matter of law.  Id., 
at 560–561. Lower courts agreed. Id., at 561–566.  But this  
Court reversed.  Id., at 581.  Whatever state law may demand, this Court explained, the parade was constitutionally protected speech and requiring the veterans to include 
voices they wished to exclude would impermissibly require 
them to “alter the expressive content of their parade.”  Id., 
at 572–573.  The veterans’ choice of what to say (and not
say)  might  have  been  unpopular,  but  they  had  a  First 
Amendment right to present their message undiluted by 
views they did not share. 
  Then there is Boy Scouts of America  v. Dale. In that case,  
the Boy Scouts excluded James Dale, an assistant scoutmaster, from membership after learning he was gay.  Mr.  
Dale argued that New Jersey’s public accommodations law 
required the Scouts to reinstate him.  530 U. S., at 644–645.   
The New Jersey Supreme Court sided with Mr. Dale, id., at 
646–647, but again this Court reversed, id., at 661.  The 
decision to exclude Mr. Dale may not have implicated pure 
speech, but this Court held that the Boy Scouts “is an expressive association” entitled to First Amendment protection.  Id., at 656.  And, the Court found, forcing the Scouts 
to include Mr. Dale would “interfere with [its] choice not to 
propound a point of view contrary to its beliefs.”   Id., at 654.  
  As these cases illustrate, the First Amendment protects 
an  individual’s  right  to  speak  his  mind  regardless  of 
whether the government considers his speech sensible and 
well intentioned or deeply “misguided,” Hurley, 515 U. S., 
at 574, and likely to cause “anguish” or “incalculable grief,” 
Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U. S. 443, 456 (2011).  Equally, the 
First Amendment protects acts of expressive association.  
See, e.g., Dale, 530 U. S., at 647–656; Hurley, 515 U. S., at 
568–570, 579.  Generally, too, the government may not compel a person to speak its own preferred messages.  See  
 
  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  9 
 
Opinion of the Court 
Tinker v. Des Moines Independent  Community School Dist., 
393 U. S. 503, 505–506 (1969); see also, e.g., Miami Herald  
Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241, 256 (1974); Wooley 
v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705, 714 (1977); National Institute of  
Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, 585 U. S. ___, ___ 
(2018) (NIFLA) (slip op., at 8).  Nor does it matter whether 
the government seeks to compel a person to speak its message when he would prefer to remain silent or to force an 
individual to include other ideas with his own speech that 
he would prefer not to include.  See Hurley, 515 U. S., at  
568–570, 576; see also Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic &  
Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U. S. 47, 63–64 (2006) (FAIR)
(discussing cases).  All that offends the First Amendment 
just the same. 
III  
  Applying these principles to this case, we align ourselves 
with much of the Tenth Circuit’s analysis.  The Tenth Circuit held that the wedding websites Ms. Smith seeks to create qualify as “pure speech” under this Court’s precedents.  
6 F. 4th, at 1176.  We agree.  It is a conclusion that flows  
directly from the parties’ stipulations.  They have stipulated that Ms. Smith’s websites promise to contain “images, 
words, symbols, and other modes of expression.”  App. to  
Pet. for Cert. 181a. They have stipulated that every website
will be her “original, customized” creation.  Id., at 181a–182a.  And they have stipulated that Ms. Smith will create 
these  websites  to  communicate  ideas—namely,  to  “celebrate and promote the couple’s wedding and unique love 
story” and to “celebrat[e] and promot[e]” what Ms. Smith 
understands to be a true marriage.  Id., at 186a–187a. 
  A hundred years ago, Ms. Smith might have furnished 
her services using pen and paper. Those services are no less 
protected speech today because they are conveyed with a 
“voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox.” Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U. S. 844, 
 
10   303 CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS  
   
Opinion of the Court 
870 (1997).  All manner of speech—from “pictures, films, 
paintings, drawings, and engravings,” to “oral utterance 
and the printed word”—qualify for the First  Amendment’s 
protections; no less can hold true when it comes to speech 
like Ms. Smith’s conveyed over the Internet.  Kaplan v. California, 413 U. S. 115, 119–120 (1973); see also Shurtleff v. 
Boston,  596  U. S.  ___,  ___–___  (2022)  (slip  op.,  at  7–8) 
(flags); Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn., 564 U. S.  
786, 790 (2011) (video games); Hurley, 515 U. S., at 568– 
570 (parades); Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781,  
790 (1989) (music); Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U. S.  
495, 501–502 (1952) (movies). 
  We further agree with the Tenth Circuit that the wedding 
websites Ms. Smith seeks to create involve her speech.  6 
F. 4th, at 1181, and n.  5.  Again, the parties’ stipulations 
lead the way to that conclusion.   See App. to Pet. for Cert. 
181a, 187a. As the parties have described it, Ms. Smith intends  to  “ve[t]”  each  prospective  project  to  determine  
whether it is one she is  willing to endorse.  Id., at 185a.  She  
will consult with clients to discuss “their unique stories as 
source material.” Id., at 186a. And she will produce a final 
story for each couple using her own words and her own 
“original  artwork.”    Id.,  at  182a–183a.    Of  course,  Ms. 
Smith’s speech may combine with the couple’s in the final  
product.  But for purposes of the First Amendment that 
changes nothing.  An individual “does not forfeit constitutional protection simply by combining multifarious voices” 
in a single communication.  Hurley, 515 U. S., at 569. 
  As surely as Ms. Smith seeks to engage in protected First 
Amendment speech, Colorado seeks to compel speech Ms. 
Smith does not wish to provide.  As the Tenth Circuit observed, if Ms. Smith offers wedding websites celebrating 
marriages she endorses, the State intends to “forc[e her] to
create custom websites” celebrating other marriages she 
does not.  6 F. 4th, at 1178.  Colorado seeks to compel this 
speech in order to “excis[e] certain ideas or viewpoints from 
 
  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  11  
 
Opinion of the Court 
the public dialogue.”  Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. 
FCC, 512 U. S. 633, 642 (1994).  Indeed, the Tenth Circuit 
recognized that the coercive “[e]liminati[on]” of dissenting 
“ideas” about marriage constitutes Colorado’s “very purpose” in seeking to apply its law to Ms. Smith.  6 F. 4th, at 
1178. 
  We part ways with the Tenth Circuit only when it comes 
to  the  legal  conclusions  that  follow.    While  that  court  
thought Colorado could compel speech from Ms. Smith consistent with the Constitution, our First Amendment precedents laid out above teach otherwise.  In  Hurley,  the Court  
found that Massachusetts impermissibly compelled speech 
in violation of the First Amendment when it sought to force 
parade organizers to accept participants who would “affec[t] 
the[ir] message.” 515 U. S., at 572. In Dale, the Court held 
that New Jersey intruded on the Boy Scouts’ First Amendment rights when it tried to require the group to “propound 
a point of view contrary to its beliefs” by directing its membership choices.  530 U. S., at 654.  And in Barnette, this 
Court found impermissible coercion when West Virginia required schoolchildren to recite a pledge that contravened 
their convictions on threat of punishment or expulsion. 319  
U. S., at 626–629.  Here, Colorado seeks to put Ms. Smith
to a similar choice:  If she wishes to speak, she must either 
speak as the State demands or face sanctions for expressing 
her own beliefs, sanctions that may include compulsory participation in “remedial . . . training,” filing periodic compliance reports as officials deem necessary, and paying monetary fines.  App. 120; supra, at 3.  Under our precedents,
that “is enough,” more than enough, to represent an impermissible  abridgment  of  the  First  Amendment’s  right  to  
speak freely.  Hurley, 515 U. S., at 574. 
  Consider what a contrary approach would mean.  Under 
Colorado’s logic, the government may compel anyone who 
speaks for pay on a given topic to accept all commissions on 
that same topic—no matter the underlying message—if the 
 
12   303 CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS  
   
Opinion of the Court 
topic somehow implicates a customer’s statutorily protected 
trait.  6  F. 4th,  at  1198  (Tymkovich,  C. J.,  dissenting).  
Taken seriously, that principle would allow the government 
to force all manner of artists, speechwriters, and others 
whose services involve speech to speak what they do not believe on pain of penalty.  The government could require “an 
unwilling Muslim movie director to make a  film with a Zionist message,” or “an atheist muralist to accept a commission celebrating Evangelical zeal,” so long as they would
make films or murals for other members of the public with
different messages.  Id., at 1199.  Equally, the government
could force a male website designer married to another man 
to  design  websites  for  an  organization  that  advocates
against same-sex marriage.  See Brief for Petitioners 26– 
27.  Countless other creative professionals, too, could be 
forced  to  choose  between  remaining  silent,  producing 
speech that violates their beliefs, or speaking their minds 
and incurring sanctions for doing so. See, e.g., Brief for Creative Professionals et al. as Amici Curiae 5–10; Brief for 
First Amendment Scholars as Amici Curiae 19–22.  As our 
precedents recognize, the First Amendment tolerates none 
of that. 
  In saying this much, we do not question the vital role public accommodations laws play in realizing the civil rights of 
all Americans.  This Court has recognized that governments in this country have a “compelling interest” in eliminating discrimination in places of public accommodation.  
Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 628 (1984);  
see also Hurley, 515 U. S., at 571–572.  This Court has recognized, too, that public accommodations laws “vindicate 
the deprivation of personal dignity that surely accompanies 
denials of equal access to public establishments.”  Heart of  
Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 250  
(1964) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also, e.g., 
Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 (1964);  Newman v.

Opinion of the Court 
Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U. S. 400 (1968) (per curiam). 
  Over time, governments in this country have expanded 
public accommodations laws in notable ways too.  Statutes  
like Colorado’s grow from nondiscrimination rules the common law sometimes imposed on common carriers and places 
of traditional public accommodation like hotels and restaurants. Dale, 530 U. S., at 656–657.  Often, these enterprises 
exercised  something  like  monopoly  power  or  hosted  or 
transported others or their belongings much like bailees.  
See, e.g.,  Liverpool & Great Western Steam Co. v. Phenix 
Ins. Co., 129 U. S. 397, 437 (1889); Primrose v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 154 U. S. 1, 14 (1894).  Over time, some  
States, Colorado included, have expanded the reach of these 
nondiscrimination rules to cover virtually every place of 
business engaged in any sales to the public.  Compare 1885
Colo. Sess. Laws pp. 132–133 (a short list of entities originally bound by the State’s public accommodations law) with 
Colo. Rev. Stat. §24–34–601(1) (currently defining a public 
accommodation to include “any place of business engaged 
in any sales to the public”).
  Importantly, States have also expanded their laws to prohibit more forms of discrimination. Today, for example, approximately half the States have laws like Colorado’s that
expressly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.2  And, as we have recognized, this is entirely “unexceptional.”  Masterpiece Cakeshop, 584 U. S., at ___ (slip

op., at 10).  States may “protect gay persons, just as [they] 
can protect other classes of individuals, in acquiring whatever products and services they choose on the same terms 
and conditions as are offered to other members of the public. And there are no doubt innumerable goods and services 
that no one could argue implicate the First Amendment.”  
Ibid.; see also Hurley, 515 U. S., at 571–572; 6 F. 4th, at  
1203 (Tymkovich, C. J., dissenting).  Consistent with all of 
this, Ms. Smith herself recognizes that Colorado and other
States are generally free to apply their public accommodations laws, including their provisions protecting gay persons, to a vast array of businesses.  Reply Brief 15; see Tr.
of Oral Arg. 45–46. 
  At the same time, this Court has also recognized that no 
public accommodations law is immune from the demands of 
the Constitution.  In particular, this Court has held, public 
accommodations statutes can sweep too broadly when deployed to compel speech.  In  Hurley, the Court commented  
favorably on Massachusetts’ public accommodations law, 
but made plain it could not be “applied to expressive activity” to compel speech.  515 U. S., at 571, 578.  In Dale, the 
Court observed that New Jersey’s public accommodations 
law had many lawful applications but held that it could “not 
justify such a severe intrusion on the Boy Scouts’ rights to 
freedom of expressive association.”  530 U. S., at 659.  And,  
once more, what was true in those cases must hold true 
here.  When a state public accommodations law and the 
Constitution collide, there can be no question which must 
prevail.  U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.

1180.  In some sense,  of course, her voice is  unique; so is 
everyone’s.  But that hardly means a State may coopt an 
individual’s voice for its own purposes.  In  Hurley, the veterans had an “enviable” outlet for speech; after all, their parade was a notable and singular event.  515 U. S., at 560, 
577–578. In Dale, the Boy Scouts offered what some might 
consider a unique experience.  530 U. S., at 649–650.  But 
in both cases this Court held that the State could not use 
its public accommodations statute to deny speakers the 
right “to choose the content of [their] own message[s].”  Hurley, 515 U. S., at 573; see Dale, 530 U. S., at 650–656.  Were 
the rule otherwise, the better the artist, the finer the writer,  
the more unique his talent, the more easily his voice could 
be conscripted to disseminate the government’s preferred  
messages.  That would not respect the First Amendment; 
more nearly, it would spell its demise.  
IV 
  Before us, Colorado appears to distance itself from the 
Tenth  Circuit’s  reasoning.    Now,  the  State  seems  to  
acknowledge that the First Amendment does forbid it from 
coercing Ms. Smith to create websites endorsing same-sex 
marriage or expressing any other message with which she 
disagrees.  See Brief for Respondents 12 (disclaiming any 
interest in “interfer[ing] with [Ms. Smith’s] choice to offer 
only websites of [her] own design”); see also Brief for United 
States as Amicus Curiae 19 (conceding that “constitutional
concerns” would arise if Colorado “require[d] petitione[r] to 
design a website” that she “would not create or convey for 
any client”). Instead, Colorado devotes most of its efforts to 
advancing an alternative theory for affirmance. 
  The State’s alternative theory runs this way.  To comply
with Colorado law, the State says, all Ms. Smith must do is 
repurpose websites she will create to celebrate marriages 
she does endorse for marriages she does not.  She sells a 
product to some, the State reasons, so she must sell the  
 
16   303 CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS  
   
Opinion of the Court 
same product to all.  Brief for Respondents 15, 20.  At bottom, Colorado’s theory rests on a belief that the Tenth Circuit erred at the outset when it said this case implicates 
pure speech.  Id., at 19.  Instead, Colorado says, this case  
involves only the sale  of an ordinary commercial product 
and  any  burden  on Ms.  Smith’s  speech is  purely  “incidental.”  Id., at 18, 25–28; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 65, 97–98.  
On the State’s telling, then, speech more or less vanishes
from the picture—and, with it, any need for First Amendment scrutiny.  In places, the dissent seems to advance the 
same line of argument.  Post,  at 29 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR,  
J.).
  This alternative theory, however, is difficult to square 
with the parties’ stipulations.  As we have seen, the State 
has stipulated that Ms. Smith does not seek to sell an ordinary commercial good but intends to create “customized  
and tailored” speech for each couple.  App. to Pet. for Cert.  
181a, 187a.  The State has stipulated that “[e]ach website 
303 Creative designs and creates is an original, customized 
creation for each client.”  Id., at 181a.  The State has stipulated, too, that Ms. Smith’s wedding websites “will be expressive in nature, using text, graphics, and in some cases 
videos to celebrate and promote the couple’s wedding and
unique love story.”  Id., at 187a.  As the case comes to us,  
then, Colorado seeks to compel just the sort of speech that 
it tacitly concedes lies beyond the reach of its powers. 
  Of course, as the State emphasizes, Ms. Smith offers her 
speech for pay and does so through 303 Creative LLC, a 
company in which she is “the sole member-owner.”  Id., at 
181a; see also post,  at 33 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J.)  (emphasizing Ms. Smith’s “commercial” activity).  But none of 
that makes a difference.  Does anyone think a speechwriter
loses his First Amendment right to choose for whom he 
works if he accepts money in return?  Or that a visual artist  
who accepts commissions from the public does the same?  
Many of the world’s great works of literature and art were

created with an expectation of compensation.  Nor, this  
Court has held, do speakers shed their First Amendment 
protections by employing the corporate form to disseminate 
their speech.  This fact underlies our cases involving everything from movie producers to book publishers to newspapers. See, e.g.,  Joseph Burstyn, Inc., 343 U. S., at 497–503;  
Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 114–116 (1991); Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233, 240–241, 249 (1936).
  Colorado next urges us to focus on the reason Ms. Smith  
refuses to offer the speech it seeks to compel.  She refuses, 
the State insists, because she objects to the “protected characteristics” of certain customers.  Brief for Respondents 16;  
see also post,  at 26–27, 31–32 (opinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J.)  
(reciting the same argument).  But once more, the parties’ 
stipulations speak differently.  The parties agree that Ms.
Smith “will gladly create custom graphics and websites for
gay, lesbian, or bisexual clients or for organizations run by 
gay, lesbian, or bisexual persons so long as the custom 
graphics and websites” do not violate her beliefs.  App. to 
Pet.  for  Cert.  184a.  That  is  a  condition,  the  parties 
acknowledge, Ms. Smith applies to “all customers.”  Ibid.  
Ms. Smith stresses, too, that she has not and will not create 
expressions that defy any of her beliefs for any customer, 
whether that involves encouraging violence, demeaning another person, or promoting views inconsistent with her religious commitments.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18–20.  Nor, in 
any event, do the First Amendment’s protections belong 
only to speakers whose motives the government finds worthy;  its  protections  belong  to  all,  including  to  speakers 
whose motives others may find misinformed or offensive.  
See Federal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, 
Inc., 551 U.  S. 449, 468–469 (2007) (opinion  of ROBERTS,

  Failing all else, Colorado suggests that this Court’s decision in FAIR supports affirmance.  See also post,  at 25–26 
(opinion of SOTOMAYOR,  J.) (making the same argument).  
In FAIR, a group of schools challenged a law requiring 
them, as a condition of accepting federal funds, to permit 
military recruiters space on campus on equal terms with 
other potential employers.  547 U.  S., at 51–52, 58.  The 
only expressive activity required of the law schools, the 
Court found, involved the posting of logistical notices along
these lines:  “‘The U. S. Army recruiter will meet interested 
 
students in Room 123 at 11 a.m.’”  Id., at 61–62.  And, the  
 
Court reasoned, compelled speech of this sort was “incidental” and a “far cry” from the speech at issue in our “leading First Amendment precedents [that] have established 
the principle that freedom of speech prohibits the government from telling people what they must say.”  Ibid.; see 
also NIFLA, 585 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).

3The dissent labels the distinction between status and message “amusing” and “embarrassing.”  Post, at 32. But in doing so, the dissent ignores 
a fundamental feature of the  Free Speech Clause.  While it does not protect status-based discrimination unrelated to expression, generally it  
does protect a  speaker’s right to control her own message—even when we 
may disapprove of the speaker’s motive or the message itself.  The dissent’s derision is no answer  to any of this.  It ignores, too, the fact that  
Colorado itself has, in other contexts, distinguished status-based discrimination (forbidden) from the right of a speaker to  control his own  
message (protected).  See App. 131, 137, 140, 143–144,  149, 152, 154.  
(Truth be told, even the dissent acknowledges “th[is] distinction” elsewhere in its opinion.  Post, at 31, n.  11.)  Nor is the distinction unusual  
in societies committed both to nondiscrimination rules and free expression. See, e.g., Lee v.  Ashers Baking Co. Ltd., [2018] UKSC 49, p. 14 (“The 
less favourable treatment was afforded to the message not to the man.”).  
Does the dissent really find  all that amusing and embarrassing?

at 8); Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 
487 U. S. 781, 795–796 (1988).  But this case involves nothing like that.  Here, Colorado does not seek to impose an 
incidental burden on speech. It seeks to force an individual 
to “utter what is not in [her] mind” about a question of political and religious significance.  Barnette, 319 U. S., at 
634.  And that, FAIR reaffirmed, is something the First 
Amendment does not tolerate.  No government, FAIR recognized, may affect a “speaker’s message” by “forc[ing]” her 
to “accommodate” other views, 547 U. S., at 63; no government may “‘alter’” the “‘expressive content’” of her message, id., at 63–64 (alteration omitted); and no government
may “interfer[e] with” her “desired message,” id., at 64. 
V 
  It is difficult to read the dissent and conclude we are looking at the same case. Much of it focuses on the evolution of 
public accommodations laws, post, at 7–13, and the strides 
gay Americans have made towards securing equal justice
under law, post, at 14–17.  And, no doubt, there is much to 
applaud here.  But none of this answers the question we 
face today:  Can a State force someone who provides her 
own  expressive  services  to  abandon  her  conscience  and 
speak its  preferred message instead?
  When the dissent finally gets around to that  question—
more than halfway into its opinion—it reimagines the facts 
of this case from top to bottom.  The dissent claims that Colorado wishes to regulate Ms. Smith’s “conduct,” not her 
speech.  Post, at 24–29.  Forget Colorado’s stipulation that 
Ms. Smith’s activities are “expressive,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 
181a, and the Tenth Circuit’s conclusion that the State 
 
20   303 CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS  
   
Opinion of the Court 
seeks to compel “pure speech,” 6 F. 4th, at 1176.  The dissent chides us for deciding a pre-enforcement challenge.  
Post, at 23.  But it ignores the Tenth Circuit’s finding that 
Ms. Smith faces a credible threat of sanctions unless she  
conforms her views to the State’s.  6 F. 4th, at 1172–1175.   
The dissent suggests (over and over again) that any burden 
on speech here is “incidental.”  Post, at 24, 26–30, 32–33.   
All despite the Tenth Circuit’s finding that Colorado intends to force Ms. Smith to convey a message she does not 
believe with the “very purpose” of “[e]liminating . . . ideas”  
that differ from its own.  6 F. 4th, at 1178.4  
  Nor does the dissent’s reimagination end there. It claims  
that, “for the first time in its history,” the Court “grants a 
business open to the public” a “right to refuse to serve members of a protected class.” Post, at 1; see also id., at 26, n. 10, 
35. Never mind that we do no such thing and Colorado itself  
has stipulated Ms. Smith will (as CADA requires) “work 
with all people regardless of . . . sexual orientation.”  App.
to Pet. for Cert. 184a.  Never mind, too, that it is the dissent 
that would have this Court do something truly novel by allowing a government to coerce an  individual to speak contrary to her beliefs on a  significant issue of personal conviction, all in order to eliminate ideas that differ from its own. 
  There is still more.  The dissent asserts that we “sweep 
under the rug petitioners’ challenge to CADA’s Communication Clause.” Post, at 26. This despite the fact the parties
and the Tenth Circuit recognized that Ms. Smith’s Communication Clause challenge hinges on her Accommodation  
Clause challenge.  (So much so that Colorado devoted less 
than two pages at the tail end of its brief to the Communication Clause and the Tenth Circuit afforded it just three

4Perplexingly,  too, the dissent suggests that, by recounting the Tenth 
 
Circuit’s conclusion on this score, we “misunderstan[d] this case” and

paragraphs in its free-speech analysis.  See Brief for Respondents 44–45; 6 F.  4th, at 1182–1183.)5   The dissent 
even suggests that our decision today is akin to endorsing a 
“separate but equal” regime that would allow law firms to 
refuse women admission into partnership, restaurants to 
deny service to Black Americans, or businesses seeking employees to post something like a “White Applicants Only” 
sign.  Post,  at 1, 16–21, 26, 28–29, 32, and n. 13, 37.  Pure  
fiction all. 
  In some places, the dissent gets so turned around about
the facts that it opens fire on its own position. For instance:  
While stressing that a Colorado company cannot refuse “the 
full and equal enjoyment of [its] services” based on a customer’s protected status, post, at 27, the dissent assures us 
that a company selling creative services “to the public” does  
have a right “to decide what messages to include or not to 
include,” post,  at 28.  But if that is true, what  are we even  
debating?
  Instead of addressing the parties’ stipulations about the 
case actually before us, the dissent spends much of its time 
adrift on a sea of hypotheticals about photographers, stationers, and others, asking if  they too provide expressive 
services covered by the First Amendment.  Post,  at 27–29,  
31–32, 37.  But those cases are not this case.  Doubtless, 
determining what qualifies as expressive activity protected  
—————— 
5Why does the dissent try to refocus this case around the Communica 
tion Clause?  Perhaps because the moment one acknowledges the parties’ 
stipulations—and the fact  Colorado seeks to use its Accommodation  
Clause to compel speech in order to ensure conformity to its own views 
on a topic of major significance—the First Amendment implications become obvious.  As does the fact that our case is nothing like a typical 
application of a public accommodations law requiring an ordinary, nonexpressive business to serve all customers or consider all applicants.  Our  
decision today does not concern—much less endorse—anything like the 
“ ‘straight couples only’ ” notices the dissent conjures out of thin air.   Post, 
   
at 26, n.  10.  Nor do the parties discuss anything of the sort in their stipulations.   
 
22   303 CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS  
   
Opinion of the Court 
by the First Amendment can sometimes raise difficult questions.  But this case presents no complication of that kind.  
The parties have stipulated  that Ms. Smith seeks to engage  
in expressive activity.  And the Tenth Circuit has recognized her services involve “pure speech.” See supra, at 6, 9.   
Nothing the dissent says can alter this—nor can it displace 
the First Amendment protections that follow. 
  The dissent’s treatment of precedent parallels its handling of the facts.  Take its remarkable suggestion that a  
government  forcing  an  individual  to  create  speech  on 
weighty issues with which she disagrees—all, as the Tenth 
Circuit found, with the goal of “[e]liminating” views it does 
not share, 6 F. 4th, at 1178—only “incidental[ly]” burdens 
First Amendment liberties.  Post, at 26–35.  Far from embracing a notion like that, our cases have rejected it time 
after time—including in the context of public accommodations laws.  See Parts II–IV, supra; FAIR, 547 U. S., at 61– 
64 (no government may affect a “speaker’s own message” by 
“forc[ing]” her to “accommodate” views she does not hold); 
Hurley, 515 U. S., at 563, 566 (using a public accommodations law to compel parade organizers to include speech
they did not believe was no mere “‘incidental’” infringement on First Amendment rights); Dale, 530 U. S., at 659  
(employing a public accommodations law to require the Boy 
Scouts to alter their admissions policies had more than “an 
incidental effect on protected speech”).6  
—————— 
6 The dissent observes that public accommodations laws may some 
times  touch on speech incidentally as  they work to ensure ordinary, nonexpressive goods and services are sold on equal terms.  Cf.  post, at 24–27  
(citing Sorrell v.  IMS Health Inc., 564 U. S. 552 (2011); Rumsfeld v.  
FAIR, 547 U. S. 47 (2006); United States v.  O’Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968)).   
But as Hurley  observed, there is nothing “incidental” about an infringement on speech when a public accommodations law is applied “peculiar[ly]” to compel expressive activity.  Hurley v.  Irish-American Gay,  
Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 572 (1995).

Opinion of the Court 
  When it finally gets around to discussing these controlling precedents, the dissent offers a wholly unpersuasive
attempt to distinguish them.  The First Amendment protections furnished in Barnette, Hurley, and Dale, the dissent 
declares, were limited to schoolchildren and “nonprofit[s],” 
and it is “dispiriting” to think they might also apply to Ms. 
Smith’s “commercial” activity.  Post,  at 32–35.  But our 
precedents  endorse  nothing  like  the  limits  the  dissent 
would project on them.  Instead, as we have seen, the First 
Amendment extends to all persons engaged in expressive 
conduct,  including  those  who  seek  profit  (such  as 
speechwriters, artists, and website designers).  See supra, 
at 16–17.  If anything is truly dispiriting here, it is the dissent’s failure to take seriously this Court’s enduring commitment to protecting the speech rights of all comers, no 
matter how controversial—or even repugnant—many may 
find the message at hand.
  Finally, the dissent comes out and says what it really 
means:  Once  Ms.  Smith  offers  some  speech,  Colorado 
“would require [her] to create and sell speech, notwithstanding [her] sincere objection to doing so”—and the dissent would force her to comply with that demand.  Post, at 
29–30.  Even as it does so, however, the dissent refuses to  
acknowledge where its reasoning leads.  In a world like  
that, as Chief Judge Tymkovich highlighted, governments 
could force “an unwilling Muslim movie director to make a

The dissent notes that our case law has not sustained every First Amendment objection to an antidiscrimination rule, as with a law firm that 
sought to exclude women from partnership.  Post, at 19–21 (citing  Hishon  
v. King & Spalding, 467 U. S. 69 (1984); Roberts v.  United States Jaycees, 
468 U. S. 609 (1984)).  But the dissent disregards Dale’s holding that  
context matters and that very different considerations come into play 
when a law is  used to force individuals to toe the government’s preferred 
line when speaking (or associating to express themselves) on matters of 
significance.  Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U. S. 640, 648–653

muralist to accept a commission celebrating Evangelical 
zeal,” and they could require a gay website designer to create websites for a group advocating against same-sex marriage, so long as these speakers would accept commissions 
from the public with different messages.  6 F. 4th, at 1199 
(dissenting opinion). Perhaps the dissent finds these possibilities untroubling because it trusts state governments to 
coerce only “enlightened” speech.   But if that is the calculation, it is a dangerous one indeed.7   
  The dissent is right about one thing—“[w]hat a difference” time can make.  See post,  at 2 (internal quotation
marks omitted).  Eighty years ago in Barnette, this Court 
affirmed that “no official, high or  petty, can prescribe what 
shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other 
matters of opinion.”  319 U. S., at 642.  The Court did so  
despite the fact that the speech rights it defended were 
deeply unpopular; at the time, the world was at war and 
many thought respect for the flag and the pledge “essential 
for the welfare of the state.”  Id., at 662–663 (Frankfurter,  
J., dissenting); see also id., at 636, 640 (majority opinion).

7Perhaps the dissent finds these possibilities untroubling  for another  
 
reason.  It asserts that CADA does not apply to “[m]any filmmakers, visual artists, and writers” because they do not “hold out” their services to  
the public. Post, at 27.  But the dissent cites nothing to support its claim 
and instead, once more, fights the facts.  As we have seen, Colorado’s law  
today applies to “any place of business engaged in  any sales to the public.” Colo. Rev. Stat. §24–34–601(1) (emphasis added); see also Part III, 
supra.  And the dissent can hardly dispute that many artists and writers 
accept commissions from the public.  Brief for Creative Professionals 
et al. as Amici Curiae 5–21.  Certainly, Colorado does not advance anything like the  dissent’s argument; it calls any exemption to its law for 
“artists” and others who provide “custom” services “unworkable.”  Brief

that “it is not . . . the role of the State or its officials to prescribe what shall be offensive.”  Masterpiece Cakeshop, 584 
U. S., at  ___ (slip op., at 16).  And just days ago, Members 
of today’s dissent joined in holding that the First Amendment restricts how States may prosecute stalkers despite 
the “harm[ful],” “low-value,” and “upsetting” nature of their 
speech.  Counterman v. Colorado, 600 U. S. ___, ___ (2023) 
(slip op., at 6); id., at ___ (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring in part 
and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 5).
  Today, however, the dissent abandons what this Court’s 
cases have recognized time and time again: A commitment 
to speech for only some messages and some persons is no 
commitment at all.  By approving a government’s effort to 
“[e]liminat[e]” disfavored “ideas,” 6 F. 4th, at 1178, today’s 
dissent is emblematic of an unfortunate tendency by some 
to defend First Amendment values only when they find the 
speaker’s message sympathetic. But “[i]f liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do 
not want to hear.”  6 F.  4th, at 1190 (Tymkovich, C. J., dissenting) (quoting G. Orwell).

  In this case, Colorado seeks to force an individual to  
speak in ways that align with its views but defy her conscience about a matter of major significance.  In the past,
other States in Barnette, Hurley, and Dale have similarly 
tested the First Amendment’s boundaries by seeking to 
compel speech they thought vital at the time.  But, as this 
Court has long held, the opportunity to think for ourselves 
and to express those  thoughts freely is among our most 
cherished liberties and part of what keeps our Republic 
strong.  Of course, abiding the Constitution’s commitment 
to the freedom of speech means all of us will encounter ideas

ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 
APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT  
[June 30, 2023] 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE  KAGAN and 
JUSTICE JACKSON join, dissenting. 
  Five years ago, this Court recognized the “general rule” 
that religious and philosophical objections to gay marriage 
“do not allow business owners and other actors in the economy and in society to deny protected persons equal access 
to goods and services under a neutral and generally applicable public accommodations law.”  Masterpiece Cakeshop,  
Ltd. v.  Colorado Civil Rights Comm’n, 584 U. S. ___, ___ 
(2018) (slip op., at 9).   The Court also recognized the “serious stigma” that would result if “purveyors of goods and services who object to gay marriages for moral and religious 
reasons” were “allowed to put up signs saying ‘no goods or 
services will be sold if they will be used for gay marriages.’”  
 
Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12). 
  Today, the Court, for the first time in its history, grants 
a business open to the public a constitutional right to refuse 
to serve members of a protected class.  Specifically, the 
Court holds that the First Amendment exempts a websitedesign company from a state law that prohibits the company from denying wedding websites to same-sex couples if 
the company chooses to sell those websites to the public.  
The Court also holds that the company has a right to post a 
notice that says, “‘no [wedding websites] will be sold if they 
 
will be used for gay marriages.’”  Ibid.

  “What a difference five years makes.”  Carson v. Makin, 
596 U. S. ___, ___ (2022) (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting) (slip
op., at 5).  And not just at the Court.  Around the country, 
there has been a backlash to the movement for liberty and
equality for gender and sexual minorities.  New forms of  
inclusion have been met with reactionary exclusion.  This  
is heartbreaking.  Sadly, it is also familiar.  When the civil 
rights and women’s rights movements sought equality in 
public life, some public establishments refused. Some even 
claimed, based on sincere religious beliefs, constitutional 
rights to discriminate.  The brave Justices who once sat on  
this Court decisively rejected those claims. 
  Now the Court faces a similar test.  A business open to
the public seeks to deny gay and lesbian customers the full 
and equal enjoyment of its services based on the owner’s 
religious belief that same-sex marriages are “false.”  The 
business argues, and a majority of the Court agrees, that 
because the business offers services that are customized 
and expressive, the Free Speech Clause of the  First Amendment shields the business from a generally applicable law 
that prohibits discrimination in the sale of publicly available goods and services.  That is wrong.  Profoundly wrong.  
As I will explain, the law in question targets conduct, not 
speech, for regulation, and the act of discrimination has 
never  constituted  protected  expression  under  the  First 
Amendment.  Our Constitution contains no right to refuse 
service to a disfavored group.  I dissent.

  A “public accommodations law” is a law that guarantees 
to every person the full and equal enjoyment of places of
public accommodation without unjust discrimination.  The 
American  people,  through  their  elected  representatives, 
have enacted such laws at all levels of government: The

national origin, or disability.1  All but five States have 
analogous laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of 
these and other traits, such as age, sex, sexual orientation, 
and  gender  identity.2    And  numerous  local  laws  offer 
similar protections.

or deny to an individual or a group, because of disability, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender 
identity, gender expression, marital status, national 
origin, or ancestry, the full and equal enjoyment of the 
goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations  of  a  place  of  public  accommodation.”  
Colo. Rev. Stat. §24–34–601(2)(a). 
This  provision,  known  as  the  Act’s  “Accommodation 
Clause,” applies to any business  engaged in sales “to the 
public.”  §24–34–601(1).  The Accommodation Clause does  
not apply to any “church, synagogue, mosque, or other place 
that is principally used for religious purposes.”  Ibid.  
  In addition, CADA contains what is referred to as the 
Act’s “Communication Clause,” which makes it unlawful to 
advertise that services “will be refused, withheld from, or 
denied,” or that an individual is “unwelcome” at a place of 
public accommodation, based on the same protected traits.  
§24–34–601(2)(a).  In other words, just as a business open 
to the public may not refuse to serve customers based on  
race, religion, or sexual  orientation, so too the business may 
not hang a sign that says, “No Blacks, No Muslims, No 
Gays.” 
  A public accommodations law has two core purposes. 
First, the law ensures “equal access to publicly available
goods and services.”  Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468  
U. S. 609, 624 (1984) (emphasis added).  For social groups 
that face discrimination, such access is vital.  All the more 
so if the group is small in number or if discrimination 
against the group is widespread.  Equal access  is mutually 
beneficial: Protected persons receive “equally effective and 
meaningful opportunity to benefit from all aspects of life in 
America,” 135 Cong. Rec. 8506 (1989) (remarks of Sen. 
Harkin) (Americans with Disabilities Act), and “society,” in 
return, receives “the benefits of wide participation in political, economic, and cultural life.”  Roberts, 468 U. S., at 625.  
 
  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  5 
 
SOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  
  Second, a public accommodations law ensures equal dignity in the common market.  Indeed, that is the law’s “fundamental object”: “to vindicate ‘the deprivation of personal 
dignity that surely accompanies denials of equal access to 
public establishments.’”  Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v.  
 
United States, 379 U. S. 241, 250 (1964) (quoting S. Rep. 
No. 872, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 16 (1964)).  This purpose does 
not depend on whether goods or services are otherwise 
available. “‘Discrimination is not simply dollars and cents, 
 
hamburgers and movies; it is the humiliation, frustration, 
and embarrassment that a person must surely feel when he 
is told that he is unacceptable as a member of the public 
because of his [social identity].  It is equally the inability to 
explain to a  child that regardless of education, civility, courtesy, and morality he will be denied the right to enjoy equal 
treatment.’”  379 U. S., at 292 (Goldberg, J., concurring).  
 
When a young Jewish girl and her parents come across a 
business with a sign out front that says, “‘No dogs or Jews 
 
allowed,’”3 the fact that another business might serve her 
 
family does not redress that “stigmatizing injury,” Roberts, 
468 U. S., at 625.  Or, put another way, “the hardship
Jackie Robinson suffered when on the road” with his baseball team “was not an inability to find some hotel that would 
have him; it was the indignity of not being allowed to stay 
in the same hotel as his white teammates.”  J. Oleske, The 
Evolution of Accommodation, 50 Harv. Civ. Rights-Civ. Lib. 
L. Rev. 99, 138 (2015).
  To illustrate, imagine a funeral home in rural Mississippi 
agrees to transport and cremate the body of an elderly man 
who has passed away, and to host a memorial lunch.  Upon  
learning that the man’s surviving spouse is also a man, 
however, the funeral home refuses to deal with the family.

Grief stricken, and now isolated and humiliated, the family 
desperately searches for another funeral home that will 
take the body. They eventually find one more than 70 miles 
away.  See  First  Amended  Complaint  in  Zawadski   v. 
Brewer  Funeral  Services,  Inc.,  No.  55CI1–17–cv–00019  
(C. C. Pearl River Cty., Miss., Mar. 7, 2017), pp. 4–7.4  This  
ostracism, this otherness, is among the most distressing 
feelings that can be felt by our social species.  K. Williams, 
Ostracism, 58 Ann. Rev. Psychology 425, 432–435 (2007). 
  Preventing the “unique evils” caused by “acts of invidious 
discrimination  in  the  distribution  of  publicly  available 
goods, services, and other advantages” is a compelling state 
interest “of the highest order.”  Roberts, 468 U. S., at 624, 
628; see Board of Directors of Rotary Int’l v. Rotary Club of 
Duarte, 481 U. S. 537,  549 (1987).  Moreover, a law that 
prohibits only such acts by businesses open to the public is
narrowly tailored to achieve that compelling interest.  The  
law “responds precisely to the substantive problem which 
legitimately concerns the State”: the harm from statusbased discrimination in the public marketplace.  Roberts, 
468 U. S., at 629 (internal quotation marks omitted).
  This last aspect of a public accommodations law deserves 
special emphasis: The law regulates only businesses that 
choose to sell goods or services “to the general public,” e.g., 
Va. Code Ann. §2.2–3904, or “to the public,” e.g., Mich.  
Comp. Laws §37.2301.  Some public accommodations laws,

alternative funeral home more than an hour from where Bob and Jack 
lived, the lunch in Bob’s memory had to be canceled.  Jack died the next 
year.

such as the federal Civil Rights Act, list establishments 
that qualify, but these establishments are ones open to the 
public generally.  See, e.g., 42 U.  S. C. §2000a(b) (hotels,  
restaurants, gas stations, movie theaters, concert halls, 
sports arenas, stadiums).  A public accommodations law 
does not force anyone to start a business, or to hold out the 
business’s goods or services to the public at large.  The law 
also does not compel any business to sell any particular 
good or service. But if a business chooses to profit from the 
public market, which is established and maintained by the 
state, the state may require the business to abide by a legal 
norm of nondiscrimination. In particular, the state may ensure that groups historically marked for second-class status 
are not denied goods or services on equal terms. 
  The concept of a public accommodation thus embodies a 
simple,  but  powerful,  social  contract:  A  business  that 
chooses to sell to the public assumes a duty to serve the 
public without unjust discrimination.  J. Singer, No Right 
To Exclude: Public Accommodations and Private Property, 
90 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1283, 1298 (1996) (Singer).  
B 
  The legal duty of a business open to the public to serve 
the public without unjust discrimination is deeply rooted in 
our history.  The true power of this principle, however, lies 
in its capacity to evolve, as society comes to understand 
more forms of unjust discrimination and, hence, to include
more persons as full and equal members of “the public.”

  “At common law, innkeepers, smiths, and others who 
‘made profession of a public employment,’ were prohibited 
from refusing, without good reason, to serve a customer.”   
Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group 
of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 571 (1995) (quoting Lane v. 
Cotton, 12 Mod. 472, 485, 88 Eng. Rep. 1458, 1465 (K. B.  
 
8  303 CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS  
   
SOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  
1701) (Holt, C. J.)).  “Public employment” meant a business 
“in which the owner has held himself out as ready to serve 
the public by exercising his trade.”  Singer 1307; see, e.g., 
Gisbourn v.  Hurst, 1 Salk. 249, 91 Eng. Rep. 220 (K. B.  
1710).  Take, for example, Lane v. Cotton, “[t]he leading 
English case” on the subject “cited over and over again in 
the nineteenth century in the United States.”  Singer 1304.  
There, Lord Chief Justice Holt explained: 
  “[W]here-ever any subject takes upon himself a public trust for the benefit  of the rest of his fellow-subjects, 
he is eo ipso bound to serve the subject in all the things 
that are within the reach and comprehension of such 
an office, under pain of an action against him. . . . If on  
the road a shoe fall off my horse, and I come to a smith 
to have one put on, and the smith refuse to do it, an 
action will lie against him, because he has made profession of a  trade which is for the public good, and has 
thereby exposed and vested an interest of himself in all 
the King’s subjects that will employ him in the way of 
his trade.”  Lane v. Cotton, 12 Mod., at 484, 88 Eng. 
Rep., at 1464. 
That is to say, a business’s duty to serve all comers derived 
from its choice to hold itself out as ready to serve the public.  
This holding-out rationale became firmly established in 
early American law. See 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 464–465 (1827); J. Story, Commentaries on the 
Law of Bailments §§495, 591 (1832); see also,  e.g., Markham v. Brown, 8 N. H. 523, 528 (1837); Jencks v. Coleman, 
13 F. Cas. 442, 443 (No. 7,258) (CC RI 1835) (Story, J.);  
Dwight v. Brewster, 18 Mass. 50, 53 (1822). 
  The majority is therefore mistaken to suggest that public 
accommodations or common carriers historically assumed 
duties to serve all comers because they enjoyed monopolies
or otherwise had market power.  Ante, at 13. Tellingly, the
majority cites no common-law case espousing the monopoly

rationale.5   That is because nowhere in the relevant case 
law “is monopoly suggested as the distinguishing characteristic.”  E. Adler, Business Jurisprudence, 28 Harv. L. Rev. 
135, 156 (1914) (“A distinction based on monopoly would require proof that the common carrier had some kind of a monopoly which the private carrier did not have, or that ‘common’ was synonymous with ‘monopoly.’  The plain meaning 
of the cases is [instead that] the common was the public, the 
professional, the business carrier or other trader”).6  
2 
  After the Civil War, some States codified the common-law 
duty of public accommodations to serve all comers.  See M. 
Konvitz & T. Leskes, A Century of Civil Rights 155–157 
(1961). Early state public accommodations statutes prohibited discrimination based on race or color. Yet the principle  
was at times stated more broadly: to provide “a remedy 
against any unjust discrimination to the citizen in all public 
places.”  Ferguson v. Gies, 82 Mich. 358, 365, 46 N. W. 718,  
720 (1890).  In 1885, Colorado adopted “‘An Act to Protect 
 
All Citizens in Their Civil Rights,’ which guaranteed ‘full

5For example, a case on which the majority relies found that it could 
 
“shortly dispos[e]” of the question whether a steamship company was a 
common carrier because the company was “the owner of a general ship,  
carrying goods for hire . . . and perform[ing]” that service “regular[ly].”   
Liverpool & Great Western Steam  Co. v. Phenix Ins. Co., 129 U. S. 397, 
437 (1889).  No showing of market power  was required.  Ibid.  
6Nor does “host[ing] or transport[ing] others and their belongings,”  
 
ante, at 13, explain the right of access.  Smiths, for instance, did not always practice  their trade by holding  property for others.  And even when  
they did, any duty of care resulting from such bailment cannot explain  
the duty to serve all comers, which logically must be assumed beforehand.  See Lane v.  Cotton, 12 Mod. 472, 484, 88 Eng. Rep. 1458, 1464  
(K. B. 1701) (Holt, C. J.).  That duty instead came from somewhere else, 
and the weight of authority indicates that  it came from a business’s act  
of holding itself out to the public as ready to serve anyone who would hire 
it.  Singer 1304–1330; 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of  
England 164 (1768); J. Story, Commentaries on the Law of Bailments

of the United States shall be entitled to the full and equal 
enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities,
and privileges of inns, public conveyances on land or water, 
theaters, and other places of public amusement . . . applicable alike to citizens of every race and color, regardless of 
any previous condition of servitude.”  Act of Mar. 1, 1875,

  This Court, however, struck down the federal Civil Rights 
Act of 1875 as unconstitutional.  Civil Rights Cases, 109  
U. S. 3, 25 (1883).  Southern States repealed public accommodations statutes and replaced them with Jim Crow laws.  
And state courts construed any remaining right of access in 
ways that furthered de jure and de facto racial segregation.7   
Full  and  equal  enjoyment  came  to  mean  “separate  but
equal” enjoyment.  The result of this backsliding was “the 
replacement of a general right of access with a general right 
to exclude . . . in order to promote a racial caste system.”

  In time, the civil rights movement of the mid-20th century again demanded racial equality in public places.  In  
1963, two decades after then–Howard University law student Pauli Murray organized sit-ins at cafeterias in Washington, D. C., a diverse group of students and faculty from 
Tougaloo College sat at Woolworth’s lunch counter in Jackson, Mississippi.  For doing so, they were violently attacked  
by a white mob.  See A. Moody, Coming of Age in Mississippi 235–240 (1992).  Around the country, similar acts of
protest against racial injustice, some big and some small, 
sought “to create such a crisis and foster such a tension” 
that the country would be “forced to confront the issue.”  M. 
King, Letter from a Birmingham Jail, Apr. 16, 1963.  That 
year, Congress once more set out to eradicate “discrimination . . . in places of accommodation and public facilities,”  
Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U. S., at 246, notwithstanding 
this Court’s previous declaration of a federal public accommodations law to be unconstitutional. 
  Congress believed, rightly, that discrimination in places
of public accommodation—“the injustice of being arbitrarily 
denied equal access to those facilities and accommodations 
which are otherwise open to the general public”—had “no 
place” in this country, the country “of the melting pot, of 
equal rights, of one nation and one people.”  S. Rep. No. 872, 
at 8–9 (quoting President Kennedy, June 19, 1963).  It 
therefore passed Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
which declares: “All persons shall be entitled to the full and 
equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, 
advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation . . . without discrimination . . . on the ground
of  race,  color,  religion,  or  national  origin.”    42  U. S. C. 
§2000a. In enacting this landmark civil rights statute, Congress invoked the holding-out rationale from  antebellum 
common law: “one who employed his private property for 
purposes of commercial gain by offering goods or services to 
the public must stick to his bargain.”  S. Rep. No. 872, at

SOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  
22; see also id., at 9–10 (endorsing Lord Holt’s view in Lane 
v. Cotton). 
  This bargain, America would soon realize, had long excluded half of society.  Women, though having won the right 
to vote half a century earlier, were not equal in public.  Instead, a “separate-spheres ideology” had “assigned women 
to the home and men to the market.”  E. Sepper & D. Dinner, Sex in Public, 129 Yale L. J. 78, 83, 88–90 (2019) (Sepper & Dinner).  Women were excluded from restaurants,  
bars, civic and professional organizations, financial institutions, and sports. “Just as it did for the civil rights struggle, 
public accommodations served as kindling for feminist mobilization.”  Id., at 83, 97–104; cf. S. Mayeri, Reasoning 
From Race: Feminism, Law, and the Civil Rights Revolution 9–40 (2011).  In response to a movement for women’s  
liberation, numerous States banned discrimination in public accommodations on the basis of “sex.”  See Sepper & Dinner 104, nn. 145–147 (collecting statutes).  Colorado was  
the first State to do so.  See 1969 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 74, p. 
200. 
  In the decades that followed, the Nation opened its eyes
to another injustice. People with disabilities, though inherently full and equal members of the public, had been excluded  from  many  areas  of  public  life.     This  exclusion 
worked harms not only to disabled people’s standards of living, but to their dignity too.  So Congress, responding once 
again to a social movement, this time against the subordination of people with disabilities, banned discrimination on 
that basis and secured by law disabled people’s equal access 
to public spaces. See S. Bagenstos, Law and the Contradictions of the Disability Rights Movement 13–20 (2009); R. 
Colker, The Disability Pendulum 22–68 (2005). The centerpiece of this political and social action was the Americans 
with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).  Title III of the ADA 
provides  that  “[n]o  individual  shall  be  discriminated

against on the basis of  disability in the full and equal enjoyment  of  the  goods,  services,  facilities,  privileges,  advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation.”  42 U. S. C. §12182(a). 
  Not only have public accommodations laws expanded to 
recognize more forms of unjust discrimination, such as discrimination based on race, sex, and disability, such laws 
have also expanded to include more goods and services as 
“public accommodations.”  What began with common inns, 
carriers, and smiths has grown to include restaurants, bars, 
movie theaters, sports arenas, retail stores, salons, gyms,
hospitals, funeral homes, and transportation networks.  See  
nn. 1–2, supra; L. Lerman & A. Sanderson, Discrimination  
in Access to Public Places: A Survey of State and Federal 
Public Accommodations Laws, 7 N. Y. U. Rev. L. & Soc.  
Change 215, 217 (1978) (“‘Public accommodations’ is a term 
 
of art which was developed by the drafters of discrimination 
laws to refer to [public] places other than schools, work 
places, and homes”).   Today, laws like Colorado’s cover “any 
place of business engaged in any sales to the public and any 
place offering services . . . to the public.”  Colo. Rev. Stat.  
§24–34–601(1);  see  also,  e.g.,  Ohio  Rev.  Code  Ann.  
§4112.01(9).  Numerous other States extend such protections to businesses offering goods or services to “the general 
public.”  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §41–1441(2); see also, e.g., 
Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 272, §92A. 
  This broader scope, though more inclusive than earlier 
state public accommodations laws, is in keeping with the 
fundamental  principle—rooted  in  the  common  law,  but
alive and blossoming in statutory law—that  the duty to 
serve without unjust discrimination is owed to everyone, 
and it extends to any business that holds itself out as ready 
to serve the public.  If you have ever taken advantage of a  
public business without being denied service because of who 
you are, then you have come to enjoy the dignity and freedom that this principle protects.

  Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, 
no less than anyone else, deserve that dignity and freedom.  
The movement for LGBT rights, and the resulting expansion of state and local laws to secure gender and sexual minorities’  full  and  equal  enjoyment  of  publicly  available 
goods and services, is the latest chapter of this great American story. 
  LGBT people have existed for all of human history.  And 
as sure as they have existed, others have sought to deny 
their existence, and to exclude them from public life.  Those 
who would subordinate LGBT people have often done so 
with the backing of law.  For most of American history,
there were laws criminalizing same-sex intimacy.  Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644, 660–661 (2015).  “Gays and
lesbians were [also] prohibited from most government employment, barred from military service, excluded under immigration laws, targeted by police, and burdened in their 
rights to associate.”  Id., at 661.  “These policies worked to
create and reinforce the belief that gay men and lesbians” 
constituted “an inferior class.”  Brief for Organization of  
American  Historians  as  Amicus  Curiae  in  Obergefell  v.  
Hodges, O. T. 2014, No. 14–556, p. 3. 
  State-sponsored discrimination was compounded by discrimination in public accommodations, though the two often went hand in hand.  The police raided bars looking for
gays and lesbians so often that some bars put up signs saying, “‘We Do Not Serve Homosexuals.’”  Id., at 13 (quoting 
   
G. Chauncey, Why Marriage 8 (2004)).  LGBT discrimination in public accommodations has continued well into the 
21st century.  See UCLA School of Law Williams Institute, 
C. Mallory & B. Sears, Evidence of Discrimination in Public 
Accommodations Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender 
Identity (2016).
  A social system of discrimination created an environment

mass shooting in U. S. history?  See S. Stolberg, For Gays 
Across America, a Massacre Punctuates Fitful Gains, N. Y.

are  still  significantly  higher  for  LGBT  people,  with 
transgender persons particularly vulnerable to attack.  See 
Dept. of Justice, J. Truman & R. Morgan, Violent Victimization by Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, 2017–

  Determined not to live as “social outcasts,” Masterpiece  
Cakeshop, 584 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9), LGBT people 
have risen up.  The social movement for LGBT rights has 
been long and complex.  See L. Faderman, The Gay Revolution (2015) (Faderman).  But if there ever was an “earthquake,” it occurred in the final days of June in 1969 at the 
Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. Id., at 169. The Stonewall Inn was a gay bar with a “varied and lively clientele.”  
Id., at 171.  Its “‘unruly’ element” made it “an especially 
 
inviting target” for police raids.  J. D’Emilio, Sexual Politics, Sexual Communities 231 (1983) (D’Emilio).  “Patrons  
of the Stonewall tended to be young and nonwhite.  Many
were drag  queens. . . . ”  Ibid.  Just before midnight on June 
27, the New York police’s Public Morals Squad showed up 
to the bar and started making arrests.  Drag queens, for 
example, were arrested for offenses like being “disguised” 
in “unnatural attire.”  N. Y. Penal Law Ann. §240.35(4) 
(West 1967).
  What started out as a fairly routine police raid, however, 
became anything but.  Outside the Stonewall Inn, patrons 
who had been thrown out started  to form a crowd.  “Jeers 
and catcalls arose from the onlookers when a paddy wagon 
departed with the bartender, the Stonewall’s bouncer, and 
 
16   303 CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS

three drag queens.”  D’Emilio 231. “A few minutes later, an 
officer attempted to steer the last of the patrons, a lesbian, 
through the bystanders to a nearby patrol car.”  Id., at 231– 
232.  When  she started to struggle, protests erupted.  They
lasted into the night and continued into the next.  News of 
the Stonewall protests “spread rapidly,” and “within a year 
gay liberation groups had sprung into existence on college 
campuses and in cities around the nation.”  Id., at 233.   
From there, the path to LGBT rights has not been quick or  
easy. Nor is it over.  Still, change has come: change in social 
attitudes,  in  representation,  and  in  legal  institutions.  
Faderman 535–629. 
  One significant change has been the addition of sexual 
orientation and gender identity to public accommodations 
laws. State and local legislatures took note of the failure of 
such laws to protect LGBT people and, in response, acted to 
guarantee them “all the privileges . . . of any other member
of society.”  Hearings on S. B. 200  before the House Judiciary Committee, 66th Gen. Assem., 2d Reg. Sess., 4, 11–12 
(Colo.  2008)  (remarks  of  Sen.  Judd).  Colorado  thus  
amended its antidiscrimination law in 2008 to prohibit the 
denial of publicly available goods or services on the basis of 
“sexual orientation.”  2008 Colo. Sess. Laws. ch. 341, pp.  
1596–1597.  About half of the States now provide such protections.8  It  is “‘unexceptional’” that they may do so.  Ante,

  Yet for as long as public accommodations laws have been 
around, businesses have sought  exemptions from them.  
The civil rights and women’s liberation eras are prominent 
examples of this.  Backlashes to race and sex equality gave 
rise  to  legal  claims  of  rights  to  discriminate,  including 
claims based on First Amendment freedoms of expression 
and association.  This Court was unwavering in its rejection 
of those claims, as invidious discrimination “has never been 
accorded affirmative constitutional protections.”  Norwood  
v. Harrison, 413 U. S. 455, 470 (1973).  In particular, the 
refusal to deal with or to serve a class of people is not an 
expressive interest protected by the First Amendment.

  Opponents of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 objected that 
the law would force business owners to defy their beliefs.  
Cf. ante, at 3.  They argued that the Act would deny them 
“any freedom to speak or to act on the basis of their religious 
convictions or their deep-rooted preferences for associating 
or not associating with certain classifications of people.”  
110 Cong. Rec. 7778 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Tower).  Congress rejected those arguments.  Title II of the Act, in particular, did not invade “rights of privacy [or] of free association,”  Congress  concluded,  because  the  establishments 
covered by the law were “those regularly held open to the

public in general.” H. R. Rep. No. 914, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 
pt. 2, p. 9 (1963); see also S. Rep. No. 872, at 92.
  Having failed to persuade Congress, opponents of Title II 
turned to the federal courts.  In Heart of Atlanta Motel, one 
of several arguments made by the plaintiff motel owner was 
that Title II violated his Fifth Amendment due process
rights by “tak[ing] away the personal liberty of an individual to run his business as he sees fit with respect to the 
selection and service of his customers.”  Brief for Appellant,  
O. T. 1964, No. 515, p. 32.  This Court disagreed, based on 
“a long line of cases” holding that “prohibition of racial discrimination in public accommodations” did not “interfer[e] 
with personal liberty.”  379 U. S., at 260. 
In Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 (1964), the 
owner of Ollie’s Barbecue (Ollie McClung) likewise argued 
that Title II’s application to his business violated the “personal rights of persons in their personal convictions” to 
deny services to Black people.  Brief for Appellees, O. T.  
1964, No. 543, p. 33 (citing, inter alia, West Virginia Bd. of  
Ed. v.  Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 (1943)).  Note that McClung 
did not refuse to transact with Black people.  Oh, no.  He  
was willing to offer them take-out service at a separate 
counter.  See Brief for NAACP Legal Defense and Educational  Fund,  Inc.,  as  Amicus  Curiae  in  Katzenbach  v.  
McClung, p. 4, n. 5.  Only integrated table service, you see, 
violated McClung’s core beliefs.  So he claimed a constitutional right to offer Black people a limited menu of his services.  This Court rejected that claim, citing its decision in 
Heart of Atlanta Motel.  See 379 U. S., at 298, n. 1. 
Next is Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises,  Inc., 390  
U. S. 400 (1968) (per curiam), in which the owner of a chain 
of drive-in establishments asserted that requiring him to 
“contribut[e]” to racial integration in any way violated the 
First Amendment by interfering with his religious liberty.  
App. to Pet. for Cert., O. T. 1967, No. 339, p. 21a.  Title II 
could not be applied to his business, he argued, because that  
 
  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  19  
 
SOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  
would “‘controven[e] the will of God.’”  390 U.  S., at 402– 
   
403, n. 5.  The Court found this argument “patently frivolous.”  Ibid.  
  Last but not least is  Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160 
(1976), a case the majority studiously avoids.  In Runyon, 
the Court confronted the question whether “commercially 
operated” schools had a First Amendment right to exclude 
Black children, notwithstanding a federal law against racial  discrimination  in  contracting.    Id.,  at  168;  see  42  
U. S. C. §1981.  The schools in question offered “educational 
services” for sale to “the general public.”  427 U. S., at 172.   
They argued that the law, as applied to them, violated their 
First Amendment rights of “freedom of speech, and association.”  Pet. for Cert., O. T. 1976, No. 75–62, p. 6; see also 
Brief for Petitioners, O. T. 1976, No. 75–62, p. 12 (“Freedom 
to teach, to express ideas”).  The Court, however, reasoned  
that the schools’ “practice” of denying educational services
to racial minorities was not shielded by the First Amendment, for two reasons: First, “the Constitution places no 
value on discrimination.”  427 U. S., at 176 (alterations and 
internal quotations marks omitted).  Second, the government’s regulation of conduct did not “inhibit” the schools’ 
ability to teach its preferred “ideas or dogma.”  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Requiring the schools to 
abide by an antidiscrimination law was not the same thing 
as compelling the schools to express teachings contrary to 
their sincerely held “belief that racial segregation is desirable.”  Ibid. 
2 
  First Amendment rights of expression and association 
were also raised to challenge laws against sex discrimination. In Roberts v.  United States Jaycees, the United States 
Jaycees sought an exemption from a Minnesota law that 
forbids discrimination on the basis of sex in public accommodations.  The U. S. Jaycees was a civic organization, 
 
20   303 CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS  
   
SOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  
which until then had denied admission to women.  The organization alleged that applying the law to require it to include women would violate its “members’ constitutional  
rights of free speech and association.”  468 U. S., at 615.  
“The power of the state to change the membership of an organization is inevitably the power to change the way in  
which it speaks,” the Jaycees argued.  Brief for Appellee,
O. T. 1983, No. 83–724, p. 19 (emphasis added).  Thus, “the  
right of the Jaycees to decide its own membership” was “inseparable,” in its view, “from its ability to freely express itself.”  Ibid.  
  This Court took a different view.  The Court held that the  
“application of the Minnesota statute to compel the Jaycees 
to accept women” did not infringe the organization’s First 
Amendment “freedom of expressive association.”  Roberts, 
468 U. S., at 622.  That was so because the State’s public 
accommodations law did “not aim at the suppression of 
speech” and did “not distinguish between prohibited and 
permitted activity on the basis of viewpoint.”  Id., at 623– 
624.  If the State had applied the law “for the purpose of 
hampering the organization’s ability to express its views,” 
that would be a different matter.  Id., at 624 (emphasis  
added).  “Instead,” the law’s purpose was “eliminating discrimination and assuring [the State’s] citizens equal access
to publicly available goods and services.”  Ibid. “That goal,”
the Court reasoned, “was unrelated to the suppression of 
expression” and “plainly serves compelling state interests 
of the highest order.”  Ibid.  
  Justice O’Connor concurred in part and concurred in the 
judgment.  See id., at 631. She stressed that the U. S. Jaycees was a predominantly commercial entity open to the 
public.  And she took the view  that there  was a First 
Amendment “dichotomy” between rights of commercial and 
expressive association.   Id., at 634.  The State, for example, 
was “free to impose any rational regulation” on commercial 
transactions themselves.  “A shopkeeper,” Justice O’Connor

explained, “has no constitutional right to deal only with persons of one sex.”  Ibid.  
  To wit, the Court had just decided in Hishon v. King & 
Spalding, 467 U. S. 69, 78 (1984),  that a law partnership 
had no constitutional right to discriminate on  the basis of 
sex in violation of Title VII.  The law partnership was an  
act of association.  Its services (legal advocacy) were expressive; indeed, they consisted of speech.  So the law firm argued that requiring it to consider a woman for the partnership  violated  its  First  Amendment  rights  “of  free  
expression” and “of commercial association.”  Brief for Respondent, O. T. 1983, No. 82–940, pp.  14–18.  This Court 
rejected that argument.  The application of Title VII did not 
“infringe constitutional rights of expression or association,” 
the Court held, because compliance with Title VII did not 
“inhibi[t]” the partnership’s ability to advocate for certain 
“ideas and beliefs.”  467 U. S., at 78 (internal quotation 
marks omitted); see also supra, at 19 (discussing Runyon, 
427 U. S., at 176).  The Court reiterated: “‘[I]nvidious pri 
vate discrimination . . . has never been accorded affirmative 
constitutional protections.’”  467 U. S., at 78 (quoting Nor 
wood, 413 U. S., at 470). 
II  
  Battling  discrimination  is  like  “battling  the  Hydra.”  
Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U. S. 529, 560 (2013) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Whenever you defeat “one form of . . . 
discrimination,” another “spr[ings] up in its place.”  Ibid.   
Time and again, businesses and other commercial entities 
have claimed constitutional rights to discriminate.  And 
time and again, this Court has courageously stood up to 
those claims—until today.  Today, the Court shrinks.  A  
business claims that it would like to sell wedding websites 
to the general public, yet deny those same websites to gay 
and lesbian couples.  Under state law, the business is free 
to include, or not to include, any lawful message it wants in  
 
22   303 CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS  
   
SOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  
its wedding websites.  The only thing the business may not 
do is deny whatever websites it offers on the basis of sexual 
orientation.  This Court, however, grants the business a  
broad exemption from state law and allows the business to 
post a notice that says: Wedding websites will be refused to 
gays and lesbians.  The Court’s decision, which conflates  
denial of service and protected expression, is a grave error. 
A 
  303 Creative LLC is a limited liability company that sells 
graphic and website designs for profit.  Lorie Smith is the 
company’s founder and sole member-owner.  Smith believes  
same-sex marriages are “false,” because “‘God’s true story 
 
of marriage’” is a story of a “‘union between one man and 
   
one woman.’”  Brief for Petitioners 4, 6–7 (quoting App. to 
 
Pet. for Cert. 188a, 189a); Tr. of Oral Arg. 36, 40–41.  Samesex marriage, according to her, “violates God’s will” and 
“harms society and children.”  App. to Pet. for Cert. 186a. 
  303 Creative has never sold wedding websites.  Smith  
now believes, however, that “God is calling her ‘to explain
His true story about marriage.’”  Brief for  Petitioners 7  
 
(quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 188a).  For that reason, she  
says, she wants her for-profit company to enter the wedding 
website business.  There is only one thing: Smith would like 
her company to sell wedding websites “to the public,” App. 
to Pet. for Cert. 189a; Colo. Rev. Stat. §24–34–601(1), but
not to same-sex couples. She also wants to post a notice on 
the company’s website announcing this intent to discriminate. App. to Pet. for Cert. 188a–189a.  In Smith’s view, “it 
would violate [her] sincerely held religious beliefs to create 
a wedding website for a same-sex wedding because, by doing so, [she] would be expressing a message celebrating and 
promoting a conception of marriage that [she] believe[s] is 
contrary to God’s design.”  Id., at 189a. 
  Again, Smith’s company has never sold a wedding website to any customer.  Colorado, therefore, has never had to

SOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  
enforce its antidiscrimination laws against the company.  
As the majority puts it, however, Smith “worries that, if she 
enters the wedding website business, the State will force 
her to convey messages inconsistent with her belief that 
marriage should be reserved to unions between one man 
and one woman.”  Ante, at 2.  So Smith and her company,
the petitioners here, sued the State in federal court.  They
sought a court decree giving them a special exemption from 
CADA’s Accommodation Clause (which, remember, makes 
it unlawful for a business to hold itself out to the public yet 
deny to any individual, because of sexual orientation, the 
full and equal enjoyment of the business’s goods or services, 
see  supra,  at  3–4)  and  CADA’s  Communication  Clause 
(which makes it unlawful to advertise that goods or services 
will be denied because of sexual orientation, see supra, 
at 4).  App. 303–304. 
  The breadth of petitioners’ pre-enforcement challenge is 
astounding. According to Smith, the Free Speech Clause of 
the First Amendment entitles her company to refuse to sell 
any “websites for same-sex weddings,” even though the 
company plans to offer wedding  websites to the general 
public.  Ibid.; see also Brief for Petitioners 22–23, and n. 2; 
Tr. of Oral Arg. 37–38.  In other words, the company claims 
a categorical exemption from a public accommodations law 
simply because the company sells expressive services.  The  
sweeping nature of this claim should have led this Court to 
reject it.  
B 
  The First Amendment does not entitle petitioners to a 
special exemption from a state law that simply requires 
them to serve all members of the public on equal terms.  
Such a law does not directly regulate petitioners’ speech at 
all, and petitioners may not escape the law by claiming an 
expressive interest in discrimination.  The First Amendment likewise does not exempt petitioners from the law’s

prohibition on posting a notice that they will deny goods or 
services based on sexual orientation.

  This Court has long held that “the First Amendment does 
not prevent restrictions directed at commerce or conduct 
from imposing incidental burdens on speech.”  Sorrell v. 
IMS Health Inc., 564 U. S. 552, 567 (2011).  “Congress, for
example, can prohibit employers from discriminating in hiring on the basis of race.  The fact that this will require an 
employer to take down a sign reading ‘White Applicants 
Only’ hardly means that the law should be analyzed as one 
regulating  the  employer’s  speech  rather  than  conduct.”   
Rumsfeld v.  Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, 
Inc., 547 U. S. 47, 62 (2006) (FAIR). This principle explains
“why an ordinance against outdoor fires might forbid burning a flag and why antitrust laws  can prohibit agreements 
in restraint of trade.”  Sorrell, 564 U. S., at 567 (citation and 
internal quotation marks omitted).
Consider United States v. O’Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968).  
In that case, the Court upheld the application of a law 
against the destruction of draft cards to a defendant who
had burned his draft card to protest the Vietnam War.  The  
protester’s conduct was indisputably expressive.  Indeed, it 
was political expression, which lies at the heart of the First 
Amendment.  Whitney v. California, 274 U.  S. 357, 375  
(1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring).  Yet the O’Brien Court focused on whether the Government’s interest in regulating 
the conduct was to burden expression.  Because it was not,  
the regulation was subject to lesser constitutional scrutiny.  
391 U. S., at 376–377, 381–382; Clark v. Community for 
Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 294, 299 (1984).  The 
O’Brien standard is satisfied if a regulation is unrelated to 
the suppression of expression and “‘promotes a substantial 
 
government interest that would be achieved less effectively

absent the regulation.’”  FAIR, 547 U. S., at 67 (quoting  
 
United States v. Albertini, 472 U. S. 675, 689 (1985)).9  
  FAIR confronted the interaction between this principle 
and an equal-access law.  The law at issue was the Solomon  
Amendment, which prohibits an institution of higher education in receipt of federal funding from denying a military 
recruiter “the same access to its campus and students that 
it provides to the nonmilitary recruiter receiving the most 
favorable access.”  547 U. S., at 55; see 10 U. S. C. §983(b).  
A group of law schools challenged the Solomon Amendment 
based on their sincere objection to the military’s “Don’t Ask, 
Don’t Tell” policy.  For those who are too young to know, 
“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was a homophobic policy that barred 
openly LGBT people from serving in the military.  LGBT 
people could serve only if they kept their identities secret.  
The idea was that their open existence was a threat to the 
military.
  The  law  schools  in  FAIR  claimed  that  the  Solomon 
Amendment infringed the schools’ First Amendment freedom of speech.  The schools provided recruiting assistance 
in the form of emails, notices on bulletin boards, and flyers.  
547 U. S., at 60–61.   As the Court acknowledged, those services “clearly involve speech.”  Id., at 60.  And the Solomon  
Amendment  required  “schools  offering  such  services  to
other recruiters” to provide them equally “on behalf of the 
military,” even if the school deeply objected to creating such 
speech.  Id., at 61.  But that did not transform the equal 
provision of services into “compelled speech” of the kind 
barred  by  the  First  Amendment,  because  the  school’s 
speech was “only ‘compelled’ if, and to the extent, the school 
provides such speech for other recruiters.”  Id., at 62.  Thus, 
—————— 
9The majority commits a fundamental error in suggesting that a law 
 
does not regulate conduct if it ever applies to expressive activities.  See  
ante, at 19, 22. This would come as a great surprise to the O’Brien Court.

SOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  
any speech compulsion was “plainly incidental to the Solomon Amendment’s regulation of conduct.”  Ibid.  
2 
  The same principle resolves this case.  The majority tries 
to sweep under the rug petitioners’ challenge to CADA’s 
Communication Clause, so I will start with it.  Recall that 
Smith wants to post a notice on her company’s homepage 
that the company will refuse to sell any website for a samesex couple’s wedding.  This Court, however, has already 
said that “a ban on race-based hiring may require employers to remove ‘White Applicants Only’ signs.”  Sorrell, 564 
U. S., at 567 (quoting FAIR, 547 U. S., at 62; some internal 
quotation marks omitted); see Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm’n on Human Relations, 413 U.  S. 376, 389 
(1973).  So petitioners concede that they are not entitled to 
an exemption from the Communication Clause unless they
are also entitled to an exemption from the Accommodation 
Clause.  Brief for Petitioners 34–35.  That concession is all 
but fatal to their argument, because it shows that even 
“pure speech” may be burdened incident to a valid regulation of conduct.10  
  CADA’s Accommodation Clause and its application here 
are valid regulations of conduct.  It is well settled that a  
public accommodations law like the Accommodation Clause 
does not “target speech or discriminate on the basis of its
content.” Hurley, 515 U. S., at 572.  Rather, “the focal point 
of its prohibition” is “on the act of discriminating against 
—————— 
10The majority  appears to find this discussion of the Communication 
 
Clause upsetting. See ante, at 20–21, and n.  5. It is easy to understand  
why: The Court’s prior First Amendment cases clearly explain that a  ban 
on discrimination may require a business to take down a sign that expresses the business owner’s intent to discriminate. See,  e.g., FAIR, 547  
U. S., at 62. This principle is deeply inconsistent with the majority’s position. Thus, a “straight couples only” notice, like the one the Court today 
allows, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 188a–189a, is itself a devastating indictment of the majority’s logic.

SOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  
individuals in the provision of publicly available goods, 
privileges, and services.”  Ibid. (emphasis added).  The 
State confirms this reading of CADA.  The law applies only 
to  status-based  refusals  to  provide  the  full  and  equal 
enjoyment of whatever services petitioners choose to sell to 
the public.  See Brief for Respondents 15–18.
  Crucially, the law “does not dictate the content of speech 
at all, which is only ‘compelled’ if, and to the extent,” the 
company offers “such speech” to other customers.  FAIR, 
547 U. S., at 62.  Colorado does not require the company to 
“speak [the State’s] preferred message.”  Ante, at 19.  Nor 
does it prohibit the company from speaking the company’s 
preferred message.  The company  could, for example, offer 
only wedding websites with biblical quotations describing 
marriage as between one man and one woman.  Brief for 
Respondents 15.  (Just as it could offer only t-shirts with 
such quotations.)  The company could also refuse to include 
the words “Love is Love” if it would not provide those words 
to any customer.  All the company has to do is offer its services without regard to customers’ protected characteristics.  Id., at 15–16.  Any effect on the company’s speech is 
therefore “incidental” to the State’s content-neutral regulation of conduct.  FAIR, 547 U. S., at 62; see Hurley, 515 
U. S., at 572–573. 
  Once these features of the law are understood, it becomes  
clear that petitioners’ freedom of speech is not abridged in 
any meaningful sense, factual or legal.  Petitioners remain 
free to advocate the idea that same-sex marriage betrays 
God’s laws. FAIR, 547 U. S., at 60; Hishon, 467 U. S., at 78; 
Runyon, 427 U. S., at 176.  Even if Smith believes God is  
calling her to do so through her for-profit company, the company need not hold out its goods or services to the public at 
large.  Many filmmakers, visual artists, and writers never 
do. (That is why the law does not require Steven Spielberg
or Banksy to make films or art for anyone who asks.  But 
cf. ante, at 12, 23–24.)  Finally, and most importantly, even 
 
28   303 CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS  
   
SOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  
if the company offers its goods or services to the public, it 
remains free under state law to decide what messages to 
include or not to include.  To repeat (because it escapes the 
majority):  The company can put whatever  “harmful” or  
“low-value” speech it wants on its websites.  It can “tell people what they do not want to hear.”  Ante, at 25 (internal 
quotation marks and brackets omitted).  All the company 
may not do is offer wedding websites to the public yet refuse 
those same websites to gay and lesbian couples.  See Runyon, 427 U. S., at 176 (distinguishing between schools’ ability to express their bigoted view “that racial segregation is 
desirable” and the schools’ proscribable “practice of excluding racial minorities”).
  Another example might help to illustrate the point.  A 
professional photographer is generally free to choose her 
subjects. She can make a living taking photos of flowers or 
celebrities.  The State does not regulate that choice.  If the 
photographer opens a portrait photography business to the 
public, however, the business may not deny to any person, 
because of  race, sex, national origin, or other protected 
characteristic, the full and equal enjoyment of whatever  
services the business chooses to  offer.  That is so even  
though portrait photography services are customized and
expressive.  If the business offers school photos, it may not 
deny  those  services  to  multiracial  children  because  the
owner does not want to create any speech indicating that 
interracial couples are acceptable.  If the business offers 
corporate  headshots,  it  may  not  deny  those  services  to 
women because the owner believes a woman’s place is in the 
home.  And if the business offers passport photos, it may 
not deny those services to Mexican Americans because the 
owner opposes immigration from Mexico.
  The same is true for sexual-orientation discrimination.  If 
a photographer opens a photo booth outside of city hall and 
offers to sell newlywed photos captioned with the words 
“Just Married,” she may not refuse to sell that service to a

newlywed gay or lesbian couple, even if she believes the 
couple is not, in fact, just married because in her view their 
marriage is “false.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. 36, 40–41.

  Because any burden on petitioners’ speech is incidental 
to CADA’s neutral regulation of commercial conduct, the 
regulation is subject to the standard set forth in O’Brien. 
That standard is easily satisfied here because the law’s application “promotes a substantial government interest that 
would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.”   
FAIR, 547 U. S., at 67 (internal quotation marks omitted).  
Indeed, this Court has  already held that the State’s goal of 
“eliminating discrimination and assuring its citizens equal 
access to publicly available goods and services” is “unrelated to the suppression of expression” and “plainly serves 
compelling state interests of the highest order.”  Roberts, 
468 U. S., at 624.  The Court has also held  that by prohibiting only “acts of invidious discrimination in the distribution 
of publicly available goods, services, and other advantages,” 
the  law  “responds  precisely  to  the  substantive  problem
which legitimately concerns the State and abridges no more 
speech . . . than is necessary to accomplish that purpose.”  
Id., at 628–629 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks 
omitted); see supra, at 4–7. 
C 
  The Court reaches the wrong answer in this case because 
it asks the wrong questions.  The question is not whether 
the  company’s  products  include  “elements  of  speech.”  
FAIR, 547 U. S., at 61.  (They do.)  The question is not even 
whether CADA would require the company to create and 
sell speech, notwithstanding the owner’s sincere objection 
to doing so, if the company chooses to offer “such speech” to 
the public.  Id., at 62.  (It would.)  These questions do not 
resolve the First Amendment inquiry any more than they 
 
30   303 CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS  
   
SOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  
did in FAIR.  Instead, the proper focus is on the character 
of state action and its relationship to expression.  Because  
Colorado seeks to apply CADA only to the refusal to provide 
same-sex couples the full and equal enjoyment of the company’s publicly available services, so that the company’s 
speech “is only ‘compelled’ if, and to the extent,” the company chooses to offer “such speech” to the public, any burden on speech is “plainly incidental” to a content-neutral 
regulation of conduct.  Ibid.  
  The majority attempts to distinguish this clear holding of 
FAIR by suggesting that the compelled speech in FAIR was  
“incidental”  because  it  was  “logistical”  (e.g.,  “The  U.  S. 
Army recruiter will meet interested students in Room 123 
at 11 a.m.”). Ante, at 18 (internal quotation marks omitted).  
This attempt fails twice over.  First, the law schools in FAIR  
alleged that the Solomon Amendment required them to create and disseminate speech propagating the military’s message, which they deeply objected to, and to include military
speakers in on- and off-campus forums (if the schools provided equally favorable services to other recruiters).  547 
U. S., at 60–61; App. 27 and Brief for Respondents 5–8 in 
Rumsfeld v.  Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, 
Inc., O. T. 2005, No. 04–1152.  The majority simply skips 
over the Court’s key reasoning for why any speech compulsion was nevertheless “incidental” to the Amendment’s regulation of conduct: It would occur only “if, and to the extent,” the regulated entity provided “such speech” to others.   
FAIR, 547 U. S., at 62.  Likewise in O’Brien, the reason the  
burden on O’Brien’s expression was incidental was not because his message was factual or uncontroversial.  But cf.  
ante, at 19. O’Brien burned his draft card to send a political 
message, and the burden on his expression was substantial.  
Still, the burden was “incidental” because it was ancillary 
to a regulation that did not aim at expression.  391 U. S., at  
377.

SOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  
  Second, the majority completely ignores the categorical 
nature of the exemption claimed by petitioners. Petitioners 
maintain, as they have throughout  this litigation, that they 
will refuse to create any wedding website for a same-sex  
couple.  Even an announcement of the time and place of a  
wedding  (similar  to  the  majority’s  example from  FAIR)
abridges petitioners’ freedom of speech, they claim, because 
“the announcement of the wedding itself is a concept that 
[Smith] believes to be false.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. 41.  Indeed, 
petitioners here concede that if a same-sex couple came
across an opposite-sex wedding website created by the company and requested an identical website, with only the 
names and date of the wedding changed, petitioners would 
refuse. Id., at 37–38.11  That is status-based discrimination, 
plain and simple.
  Oblivious to this fact, the majority insists that petitioners
discriminate based on message, not status.  The company, 
says the majority, will not sell same-sex wedding websites 
to anyone.  Ante, at 17.  It will sell only opposite-sex wedding websites; that is its service.  Petitioners, however, 
“cannot define their service as ‘opposite-sex wedding [websites]’ any more than a hotel can recast its services as 
‘whites-only lodgings.’”  Telescope Media Group v. Lucero, 
 
—————— 
11Because petitioners have never sold a wedding website to anyone, 
 
the record contains only a mockup website.  The mockup confirms what 
you would expect: The website provides details of the event, a form to 
RSVP, a gift registry, etc.  See App. 51–72.  The customization of these  
elements pursuant to a content-neutral regulation of conduct does not 
unconstitutionally intrude upon any protected expression of the website 
designer.  Yet Smith claims a First Amendment right to refuse to provide  
any wedding website for a same-sex couple.  Her claim therefore rests on 
the idea that her act of service is itself a form of protected expression.  In  
granting Smith’s claim, the majority collapses the distinction between 
status-based and message-based refusals  of service.  The history shows
just how profoundly wrong that is.  See Runyon v.  McCrary, 427 U. S.  
160, 176 (1976); Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U. S. 69, 78 (1984); Roberts v.  United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 622–629 (1984).

SOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  
936 F. 3d 740, 769 (CA8 2019) (Kelly, J., concurring in part 
and dissenting in part).  To allow a business open to the 
public to define the expressive quality of its goods or services to exclude a protected group would nullify public accommodations laws. It would mean that a large retail store 
could sell “passport photos for white people.” 
  The majority protests that Smith will gladly sell her 
goods and services to anyone, including same-sex couples. 
Ante, at 2, 17.  She just will not sell websites for same-sex  
weddings. Apparently, a gay or lesbian couple might buy a 
wedding website for their straight friends.  This logic would  
be amusing if it were not so embarrassing.12  I suppose the
Heart of Atlanta Motel could have argued that Black people 
may still rent rooms for their white friends.  Smith answers  
that she will sell other websites for gay or lesbian clients.  
But then she, like Ollie McClung, who would serve Black 
people take-out but not table service, discriminates against
LGBT people by offering them a limited menu.13  This is  
plain to see, for all who do not look  the other way. 
  The majority, however, analogizes this case to Hurley and 
Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U. S. 640 (2000).  The 
law schools in FAIR likewise relied on Hurley  and Dale to 
argue that the Solomon Amendment violated their freespeech rights.  FAIR confirmed, however, that a neutral 
regulation  of  conduct  imposes  an  incidental  burden  on 
speech when the regulation grants a right of equal access 
—————— 
12The majority tacitly acknowledges the absurdity.  At the start of its  
 
opinion, it explains that Smith “decided to expand her offerings to include services for couples seeking websites for their weddings.”  Ante, at 1 
(emphasis added).  
13What is “‘embarrassing’” about this reasoning is not, as the Court 
     
claims, the “distinction between status and message.”  Ante, at 18, n.  3.  
It is petitioners’ contrivance, embraced by  the Court, that a prohibition 
on status-based discrimination can be avoided by asserting that a group 
can always buy services on  behalf of others, or else that the group can 
access a “separate but equal” subset  of the services made available to 
everyone else.

that requires the regulated party to provide speech only if, 
and to the extent, it provides such speech for others.  Supra, 
at 25–26, 29–30. 
  Hurley and Dale, by contrast, involved “peculiar” applications of public accommodations laws, not to “the act of discriminating . . . in the provision of publicly available goods” 
by “clearly commercial entities,” but rather to private, nonprofit expressive associations in ways that  directly burdened speech.  Hurley, 515 U. S., at 572 (private parade); 
Dale, 530 U. S., at 657 (Boy Scouts).  The Court in Hurley  
and Dale  stressed that the speech burdens in those cases 
were not incidental to prohibitions on status-based discrimination because the associations did not assert that “mere 
acceptance of a member from a particular group would impair [the association’s] message.”  Dale, 530 U. S., at 653;  
see also ibid. (reasoning that Dale was excluded for being a 
gay rights activist, not for being gay); ibid. (explaining that
in Hurley, “the parade organizers did not wish to exclude
the GLIB [Irish-American gay, lesbian, and bisexual group] 
members because of their sexual orientations, but because 
they wanted to march behind a GLIB banner”); Hurley, 515 
U. S., at 572–573. 
  Here, the opposite is true.  303 Creative LLC is a “clearly 
commercial entit[y].” Dale, 530 U. S., at 657.  The company
comes under the regulation of CADA only if it sells services 
to the public, and only if it denies the equal enjoyment of 
such services because of sexual orientation.  The State confirms that the company is free to include or not to include 
any message in whatever services it chooses to offer.  Supra, 
at 26–28.   And the company confirms that it plans to engage 
in status-based discrimination.  Supra, at 22–23, 31–32.   
Therefore, any burden on the company’s expression is incidental to the State’s content-neutral regulation of commercial conduct. 
  Frustrated by this inescapable logic, the majority dials up 
the rhetoric, asserting that “Colorado seeks to compel [the 
 
34   303 CREATIVE LLC v. ELENIS  
   
SOTOMAYOR,  J., dissenting  
company’s] speech in order to excise certain ideas or viewpoints from the public dialogue.”  The State’s “very purpose 
in seeking to apply its law,” in the majority’s view, is “the 
coercive elimination of dissenting ideas about marriage.”  
Ante,  at  10–11  (internal  quotation  marks  and  brackets  
omitted).14  That is an astonishing view of the law.  It is 
contrary to the fact that a law requiring public-facing businesses to accept all comers “is textbook viewpoint neutral,”  
Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal., Hastings College of Law v. Martinez, 561 U. S. 661, 695 (2010); contrary 
to the fact that the Accommodation Clause and the State’s  
application of it here allows Smith to include in her company’s goods and services whatever “dissenting views about 
marriage” she wants; and contrary to this Court’s clear  
holdings that the purpose of  a public accommodations law, 
as applied to the commercial act of discrimination in the 
sale of publicly available goods and services, is to ensure 
equal access to and equal dignity in the public marketplace, 
supra, at 4–6. 
  So it is dispiriting to read the majority suggest that this 
case resembles West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 
U. S. 624 (1943).  A content-neutral equal-access policy is 
“a far cry” from a mandate to “endorse” a pledge chosen by 
the Government.  FAIR, 547 U. S., at 62.  This Court has 
said “it trivializes the freedom protected in Barnette” to  
equate the two.  Ibid.   Requiring Smith’s company to abide 
by a law against invidious discrimination in commercial 
sales to the public does not conscript her into espousing the 
government’s message.  It does not “invad[e]” her “sphere of 
intellect” or violate her constitutional “right to differ.”  Ante, 
at 2, 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).  All it does is

14The majority’s repeated invocation of this Orwellian thought policing 
 
is revealing of just how much it misunderstands this case.  See ante, at

and that it will punish Smith unless she “conforms her views to the 
State’s”).

III  
  Today is a sad day in American constitutional law and in 
the lives of LGBT people.  The Supreme Court of the United 
States declares that a particular kind of business, though 
open to the public, has a constitutional right to refuse to 
serve members of a protected class.  The Court does so for 
the first time in its history.  By issuing this new license to 
discriminate in a case brought by a company that seeks to 
deny same-sex couples the full and equal enjoyment of its 
services, the immediate, symbolic effect of the decision is to 
mark gays and lesbians for second-class status.  In this way, 
the decision itself inflicts a kind of stigmatic harm, on top 
of any harm caused by denials of service.  The opinion of the
Court is, quite literally, a notice that reads: “Some services 
may be denied to same-sex couples.” 
  “The truth is,” these “affronts and denials” “are intensely 
human and personal.”  S. Rep. No. 872, at 15 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Sometimes they may “harm the 
physical body, but always they strike at the root of the human spirit, at the very core of human dignity.”  Ibid.  To see 
how, imagine a same-sex couple browses the public market 
with their child.  The market could be online or in a shopping mall.  Some stores sell products that are customized 
and expressive.  The family sees a notice announcing that 
services will be refused for same-sex weddings.  What message does that send? It sends the message that we live in a 
society with social castes.  It says to the child of the same

sex couple that their parents’ relationship is not equal to 
others’.  And it reminds LGBT people of a painful feeling 
that they know all too well: There are some public places 
where they can be themselves, and some where they cannot.  
K. Yoshino, Covering 61–66 (2006).  Ask any LGBT person, 
and you will learn just how often they are forced to navigate 
life in this  way.  They must ask themselves:  If I reveal my 
identity to this co-worker, or  to this shopkeeper, will they 
treat me the same way? If I hold the hand of  my partner in 
this setting, will someone stare at me, harass me, or even  
hurt me? It is an awful way to live.  Freedom from this way 
of life is the very object of a law that declares: All members 
of the public are entitled to inhabit public spaces on equal 
terms. 
  This case cannot be understood outside of the context in  
which it arises.  In that context, the outcome is even more  
distressing. The LGBT rights movement has made historic 
strides, and I am proud of the role this Court recently 
played in that history. Today, however, we are taking steps
backward.  A slew of anti-LGBT laws have been passed in 
some parts of the country,15 raising the specter of a “bare 
. . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group.”  Romer, 
517 U. S., at 634 (internal quotation marks omitted).  This  
is especially unnerving when “for centuries there have been 
powerful voices to condemn” this small minority. Lawrence  
v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 571 (2003).  In this pivotal moment, 
the Court had an opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to 
equality  on  behalf  of   all  members  of  society,  including 
LGBT people.  It does not do so.  
  Although the consequences of today’s decision might be 
most pressing for the LGBT community, the decision’s logic

15These laws variously censor discussion of sexual orientation and   
 
gender identity in schools, see, e.g., 2023 Ky. Acts pp. 775–779, and ban  
drag shows in public, see 2023 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 2.  Yet we are told  
that the real threat to free speech is that a commercial business open to 
the public might have to serve all members of the public.

cannot be limited to discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation or gender identity.  The decision threatens to  
balkanize the market and to allow the exclusion of other 
groups  from  many  services.  A  website  designer  could 
equally refuse to create a wedding website for an interracial 
couple, for example.  How quickly we forget that opposition 
to interracial marriage was often because “‘Almighty God 
 
. . . did not intend for the races to mix.’” Loving v. Virginia, 
 
388 U. S. 1, 3 (1967).  Yet the reason for discrimination need 
not even be religious, as this case arises under the Free 
Speech Clause.  A stationer could refuse to sell a birth announcement for a disabled couple because she opposes their 
having a child.  A large retail store could reserve its family 
portrait services for “traditional” families. And so on.16  
  Wedding  websites,  birth  announcements,  family  portraits, epitaphs.  These are not just words and images.  
They are the most profound moments in a human’s life.  
They are the moments that give that life personal and cultural meaning.  You already heard the story of Bob and 
Jack, the elderly gay couple forced to find a funeral home 
more than an hour away.  Supra, at 5–6, and n. 4.  Now 
hear the story of Cynthia and Sherry, a lesbian couple of 13 
years until Cynthia died from cancer at age 35.  When Cynthia was diagnosed, she drew up a will, which authorized 
Sherry to make burial arrangements.  Cynthia had asked
Sherry to include an inscription on her headstone, listing
the relationships that were important to her, for example, 
“daughter, granddaughter, sister, and aunt.”  After Cynthia

16The potential implications of the Court’s logic are deeply troubling.  
 
Would Runyon  v. McCrary  have come out differently if the schools had 
argued that accepting Black children would have required them to create 
original speech, like lessons, report cards, or diplomas, that they deeply 
objected to?  What if the law firm in Hishon v. King & Spalding had  
argued that promoting a woman to the partnership would have required 
it to alter its speech, like letterhead or court filings, in ways that it would 
rather not? Once  you look  closely, “compelled speech” (in the majority’s  
facile understanding of that  concept) is everywhere.

died, the cemetery was willing to include those words, but 
not  the  words  that  described  Cynthia’s  relationship  to 
Sherry: “‘beloved life partner.’”  N. Knauer, Gay and Les   
bian Elders 102 (2011).  There are many such stories, too
many to tell here.  And after today, too many to come. 
  I fear that the symbolic damage of the Court’s opinion is 
done.  But that does not mean that we are powerless in the 
face of the decision.  The meaning of our Constitution is 
found not in any law volume, but in the spirit of the people 
who live under it.  Every business owner in America has a 
choice whether to live out the values in the Constitution.  
Make no mistake: Invidious discrimination is not one of  
them. “[D]iscrimination in any form and in any degree has 
no justifiable part whatever in our democratic way of life.”   
Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214, 242 (1944) (Murphy, J., dissenting). “It is unattractive in any setting but it 
is utterly revolting among a free people who have embraced 
the principles set forth in the Constitution of the United 
States.”  Ibid.  
  The unattractive lesson of the majority opinion is this:
What’s mine is mine, and what’s yours is yours.  The lesson 
of the history of public accommodations laws is altogether 
different.  It is that in a free and democratic society, there 
can be no social castes.  And for that to be true, it must be 
true in the public market.  For the “promise of freedom” is 
an empty one if the Government is “powerless to assure
that a dollar in the hands of [one person] will purchase the 
same thing as a dollar in the hands of a[nother].”  Jones v. 
Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409, 443 (1968).  Because the  
Court today retreats from that promise, I dissent.
