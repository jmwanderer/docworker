GERALD E. GROFF, PETITIONER v.
LOUIS DEJOY, POSTMASTER GENERAL
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT
[June 29, 2023]
JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires employers to accommodate the religious practice of their employees unless  doing so would impose an “undue hardship on
the conduct of the employer’s business.”  78 Stat. 253, as
amended, 42 U. S. C. §2000e(j).  Based on a line in this
Court’s decision in Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison,
432 U. S. 63, 84 (1977), many lower courts, including the
Third Circuit below, have interpreted “undue hardship” to
mean any effort or cost that is “more than . . . de minimis.”
In this case, however, both parties—the plaintiff-petitioner,
Gerald Groff, and the defendant-respondent, the Postmaster General, represented by the Solicitor General—agree
that the de minimis reading of Hardison is a mistake.  With
the benefit of thorough briefing and oral argument, we today clarify what Title VII requires.
I
Gerald Groff is an Evangelical Christian who believes for
religious reasons that Sunday should be devoted to worship
and rest, not “secular labor” and the “transport[ation]” of
worldly “goods.”  App. 294.  In 2012, Groff began his employment with the United States Postal Service (USPS),
which has more than 600,000 employees.  He became a Rural Carrier Associate, a job that required him to assist regular carriers in the delivery of mail.  When he  took the position, it generally did not involve Sunday work.  But within
a few years, that changed.  In 2013, USPS entered into an
agreement with Amazon to begin facilitating Sunday deliveries, and in 2016, USPS signed a memorandum of understanding with the relevant union (the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association) that set out how Sunday and
holiday parcel delivery would be handled.  During a 2month peak season, each post office would use its own staff
to deliver packages. At all other times, Sunday and holiday
deliveries would be carried out by employees (including Rural Carrier Associates like Groff) working from a “regional
hub.” For Quarryville, Pennsylvania, where Groff was originally stationed, the regional hub was the Lancaster Annex.
The memorandum specifies the order in which USPS employees are to be called on for Sunday work outside the peak
season. First in line are each hub’s “Assistant Rural Carriers”— part-time employees who are assigned to the hub and
cover only Sundays and holidays.  Second are any volunteers from the geographic area, who are assigned on a rotating basis. And third are all other carriers, who are compelled to do the work on a rotating basis.  Groff fell into this
third category, and after the memorandum of understanding was adopted, he was told that he would be required to
work on Sunday.  He then sought and received a transfer to
Holtwood, a small rural USPS station that had only seven
employees and that, at the time, did not make Sunday deliveries.  But in March 2017, Amazon deliveries  began there
as well.
With Groff unwilling to work on Sundays, USPS made
other arrangements.  During the peak season, Sunday deliveries that would have otherwise been performed by Groff
were carried out by the rest of the Holtwood staff, including
the postmaster, whose job ordinarily does not involve delivering mail.  During other months, Groff ’s Sunday assignments were redistributed to other carriers assigned to the
regional hub.1  Throughout this time, Groff continued to receive “progressive discipline” for failing to work on Sundays.  35 F. 4th 162, 166 (CA3 2022).  Finally, in January
2019, he resigned.2
A few months later, Groff sued under Title VII, asserting
that USPS could have accommodated his Sunday Sabbath
practice  “without  undue  hardship  on  the  conduct  of
[USPS’s] business.”  42 U. S. C. §2000e(j).  The District
Court  granted  summary  judgment  to  USPS,  2021  WL
1264030 (ED Pa., Apr. 6, 2021), and the Third Circuit affirmed.  The panel majority felt that it was “bound by [the]
ruling” in Hardison, which it construed to mean “that requiring an employer ‘to bear more than a de minimis cost’
to provide a religious accommodation is an undue hardship.”  35 F. 4th, at 174, n. 18 (quoting 432 U. S., at 84).
Under Circuit precedent, the panel observed, this was “not
a difficult threshold to pass,” 35 F. 4th, at 174 (internal quotation marks omitted), and it held that this low standard
was met in this case.   Exempting Groff from Sunday work,
the panel found, had “imposed on his coworkers, disrupted
——————
1 Other employees complained about the consequences of Groff ’s absences.  While the parties dispute some of the details, it appears uncontested that at least one employee filed a grievance asserting a conflict
with his contractual rights.  After disputing any conflict with contract
rights, USPS eventually settled that claim, with the settlement reaffirming USPS’s commitment to the Memorandum of Understanding.  App.
118, 125–126.
2 Groff represents that his resignation was in light of expected termination, and the District Court found “a genuine issue of material fact”
foreclosed summary judgment as to whether Groff suffered an adverse
employment action.  2021 WL 1264030,*8 (ED Pa., Apr.  6, 2021).  The
Government does not dispute the point in this Court.
the workplace and workflow, and diminished employee morale.”  Id., at 175.  Judge Hardiman dissented, concluding
that adverse “effects on USPS employees in Lancaster or
Holtwood” did not alone suffice to show the needed hardship “on the employer’s business.”   Id., at 177 (emphasis in
original).
We granted Groff ’s ensuing petition for a writ of certiorari.  598 U. S. ___ (2023).
II
Because this case presents our first opportunity in nearly
50 years to explain the contours of Hardison, we begin by
recounting the legal backdrop to that case, including the development of the Title VII provision barring religious discrimination and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s  (EEOC’s)  regulations  and  guidance  regarding
that prohibition.  We then summarize how the Hardison
case progressed to final decision, and finally, we discuss
how courts and the EEOC have understood its significance.
This background helps to explain the clarifications we offer
today.
A
Since its passage, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
has made it unlawful for covered employers “to fail or refuse
to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges [of] employment,
because of such individual’s . . . religion.”  42 U. S. C.
§2000e–2(a)(1) (1964 ed.).  As originally enacted, Title VII
did not spell out what it meant by discrimination “because
of . . . religion,” but shortly after the statute’s passage, the
EEOC interpreted that provision to mean that employers
were sometimes required to “accommodate” the “reasonable
religious needs of employees.” 29 CFR § 1605.1(a)(2) (1967).
After some tinkering, the EEOC settled on a formulation
that obligated employers “to make reasonable accommodations to the religious needs of employees” whenever that
would not work an “undue hardship on the conduct of the
employer’s business.”  29 CFR § 1605.1 (1968).
Between 1968 and 1972, the EEOC elaborated on its understanding of “undue hardship” in a “long line of decisions”
addressing a variety of policies.  Hardison, 432 U. S., at 85
(Marshall, J., dissenting); see Brief for General Conference
of Seventh-day Adventists as Amicus Curiae 10–22 (collecting decisions).  Those decisions addressed many accommodation issues that still arise frequently today, including the
wearing of religious garb3 and time off from work to attend
to religious obligations.4
EEOC decisions did not settle the question of undue hardship.  In 1970, the Sixth Circuit held (in a Sabbath case)
that Title VII as then written did not require an employer
——————
3 See, e.g., EEOC Dec. No. 71–779, 1970 WL 3550, *2 (Dec. 21, 1970)
(no undue hardship in permitting nurse to wear religious headscarf).
4See EEOC Dec. No. 71–463, 1970 WL 3544, *1–*2 (Nov. 13, 1970) (no
“undue hardship” or “unreasonable burde[n]” for employer to train coworker to cover two-week religious absence); EEOC Dec. No. 70–580,
1970 WL 3513, *1–*2 (Mar. 2, 1970) (manufacturing employer asked to
accommodate sundown-to-sundown Sabbath observance  did not carry
“burden . . . to demonstrate undue hardship” where it did not address
“whether another employee could be trained to substitute for the Charging Party during Sabbath days, or  whether already qualified personnel
ha[d] been invited to work a double shift”); EEOC Dec. No. 70–670, 1970
WL 3518, *2 (Mar. 30, 1970) (no “undue  ‘hardship’ ” in having other employees take on a few more on-call Saturdays per year); see also EEOC
Dec. No. 70–110, 1969 WL 2908, *1–*2 (Aug. 27, 1969) (employer could
not deny employee all Sunday “overtime opportunities” on basis of employee’s religious inability to work Saturday, where others not working
the full weekend had been accommodated, notwithstanding employer’s
claim of “considerable expense”); EEOC Dec. No. 70–99, 1969 WL 2905,
*1 (Aug. 27, 1969) (no obligation to accommodate seasonal employee unavailable for Saturday work, where employer showed both “no available
pool of qualified employees” to substitute and a “practical impossibility
of obtaining and training an employee” to cover one day a week for six
weeks).
“to accede to or accommodate” religious practice because
that “would raise grave” Establishment Clause questions.
Dewey v. Reynolds Metals Co., 429 F. 2d 324, 334.  This
Court granted certiorari, 400 U. S. 1008, but then affirmed
by an evenly divided vote, 402 U. S. 689 (1971).
Responding to Dewey and another decision rejecting any
duty to accommodate an employee’s observance of the Sabbath, Congress amended Title VII in 1972.  Hardison, 432
U. S., at 73–74; id., at 88–89 (Marshall, J., dissenting).
Tracking the EEOC’s regulatory language, Congress provided that “[t]he term ‘religion’ includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an
employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee’s or prospective employee’s religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the
conduct of the employer’s business.”  42 U. S. C. §2000e(j)
(1970 ed., Supp. II).
B
The Hardison case concerned a dispute that arose during
the interval between the issuance of the EEOC’s ”undue
hardship” regulation and the 1972 amendment to Title VII.
In 1967, Larry Hardison was hired as a clerk at the Stores
Department in the Kansas City base of Trans World Airlines (TWA).  The Stores Department was responsible for
providing parts needed to repair and maintain aircraft.
Hardison  v.  Trans World Airlines, 375 F. Supp. 877, 889
(WD Mo. 1974).  It played an “essential role” and operated
“24 hours per day, 365 days per year.”  Hardison, 432 U. S.,
at 66. After taking this job, Hardison underwent a religious
conversion.  He began to observe the Sabbath by absenting
himself from work from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday, and this conflicted with his work schedule.  The
problem was solved for a time when Hardison, who worked
in Building 1, switched to the night shift, but it resurfaced
when he sought and obtained a transfer to the day shift in
Building 2 so that he could spend evenings with his wife.
375 F. Supp., at 889.  In that new building, he did not have
enough seniority to avoid work during his Sabbath.  Attempts at accommodation failed, and he was eventually
“discharged on grounds of insubordination.”  432 U. S., at
69.
Hardison sued TWA and his union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM).5  The
Eighth Circuit found that reasonable accommodations were
available, and it rejected the defendants’ Establishment
Clause arguments.  Hardison  v.  Trans World Airlines, Inc.,
527 F. 2d 33, 42–44 (1975).
Both TWA and IAM then filed petitions for certiorari,
with  TWA’s  lead  petition  asking  this  Court  to  decide
whether the 1972 amendment of Title VII violated the Establishment Clause as applied in the decision  below, particularly insofar as that decision had approved an accommodation that allegedly overrode seniority rights granted by
the relevant collective bargaining agreement.6  The Court
granted both petitions. 429 U. S. 958 (1976).
When the Court took that action, all counsel had good
reason to expect that the Establishment Clause would figure prominently in the Court’s analysis.  As noted above, in
June 1971, the Court, by an equally divided vote, had affirmed the Sixth Circuit’s decision in Dewey, which had
heavily relied on Establishment Clause avoidance to reject
the interpretation of Title VII set out in the EEOC’s reasonable-accommodation  guidelines.    Just  over  three  weeks
later, the Court had handed down its (now abrogated)7 decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971) which

nondiscrimination rules.  42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(c) (1964 ed.).

1975, No. 75–1126, pp. 2–3, 17–22.

op., at 22).
adopted a test under which any law whose “principal or primary  effect”  “was  to  advance  religion”  was  unconstitutional.  Id., at 612–613.  Because it could be argued that
granting a special accommodation to a religious practice
had just such a purpose and effect, some thought that
Lemon posed a serious problem for the 1972 amendment of
Title VII. And shortly before review was granted in Hardison, the Court had announced that the Justices were evenly
divided in a case that challenged the 1972 amendment as a
violation of  the Establishment Clause.  Parker Seal Co. v.
Cummins, 429 U. S. 65 (1976) (per curiam).
Against this backdrop, both TWA and IAM challenged
the constitutionality of requiring any accommodation for religious practice. The Summary of Argument in TWA’s brief
began with this categorical assertion: “The religious accommodation requirement of Title VII violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.”  Brief for Petitioner
TWA in O. T. 1976, No. 75–1126, p.  19.  Applying the threepart Lemon test, TWA argued that any such accommodation has the primary purpose and effect of advancing religion and entails “pervasive” government “entanglement . . .
in religious issues.”  Brief for Petitioner TWA in No. 751126, at 20.  The union’s brief made a similar argument,
Brief for Petitioner IAM, O. T. 1976, No. 75–1126, pp. 21–
24, 50–72, but stressed the special status of seniority rights
under Title VII, id., at 24–36.
Despite the prominence of the Establishment Clause in
the briefs submitted by the parties and their amici,8 constitutional concerns played no on-stage role in the Court’s
opinion, which focused instead on seniority rights.9  The

Clause), in Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, O. T. 1976, No. 75–
1126 etc.
9The background summarized above and the patent clash  between the
opinion stated that “the principal issue on which TWA and
the union came to this Court”  was whether Title VII “require[s] an employer and a union who have agreed on a seniority system to deprive senior employees of their seniority
rights in order to accommodate a junior employee’s religious practices.” 432 U. S., at 83, and n. 14.  The Court held
that Title VII imposed no such requirement.  Ibid.  This
conclusion, the Court found, was “supported by the fact that
seniority systems are afforded special treatment under Title VII itself.”  Id., at 81.  It noted that Title VII expressly
provides special protection for “‘bona fide seniority . . . system[s],’” id., at 81–82 (quoting 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(h)), and
it cited precedent reading the statute “‘to make clear that
——————
ordinary meaning of “undue hardship” and “more than . . . de minimis”
led some to interpret the decision to rest on Establishment Clause concerns.  Justice Marshall observed in his  Hardison dissent that the majority opinion “ha[d] the singular advantage of making consideration of
petitioners’ constitutional challenge unnecessary.”  432 U. S., at 89.  A
few  courts  assumed  that  Hardison  actually  was  an  Establishment
Clause decision. See,  e.g., Gibson v.  Missouri Pacific R. Co., 620 F. Supp.
85, 88–89 (ED Ark. 1985) (concluding that requiring an employer to “incur  greater than de minimis costs” related to accommodating a Sabbath
“would therefore violate the establishment clause”); see also Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth.  v.  Massachusetts Comm’n Against Discrimination, 450 Mass. 327, 340–341, and n.  15, 879 N. E. 2d 36, 46–48, and n.15
(2008) (construing state law narrowly on premise that Hardison might
state outer  constitutional bounds).  Some constitutional scholars also
suggested that  Hardison must have been based on constitutional avoidance. See, e.g., P. Karlan & G. Rutherglen, Disabilities, Discrimination,
and  Reasonable  Accommodation,  46  Duke  L.  J.  1,  6–7  (1996);  M.
McConnell, Accommodation of Religion: An Update and a Response to
the Critics, 60 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 685, 704 (1992); cf. Small v.  Memphis
Light, Gas & Water, 952 F. 3d 821, 829 (CA6 2020) (Thapar, J., concurring). In doing so, some have pointed to Hardison’s passing reference to
a need to avoid “unequal treatment  of employees on the basis of their
religion.”  432 U. S., at 84.  But the Court later clarified that “Title VII
does not demand mere neutrality with regard to religious practices” but
instead “gives them favored treatment” in order to ensure religious persons’ full participation in the workforce.  EEOC v.  Abercrombie & Fitch
Stores, Inc., 575 U. S. 768, 775 (2015).
the routine application of a bona fide seniority system [is]
not . . . unlawful under Title VII.’”  432 U. S., at 82 (quoting
Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 352 (1977)).  Invoking these authorities, the Court found that the statute
did not require an accommodation that involuntarily deprived employees of seniority rights.  432 U. S., at 80.10
Applying this interpretation of Title VII and disagreeing
with the Eighth Circuit’s evaluation of the factual record,
the Court identified no way in which TWA, without violating  seniority  rights,  could  have  feasibly  accommodated
Hardison’s request for an exemption from work on his Sabbath.  The Court found that not enough co-workers were
willing to take Hardison’s shift voluntarily, that compelling
them to do so would have violated their seniority rights, and
that leaving the Stores Department short-handed would
have adversely affected its “essential” mission.  Id., at 68,
80.
The Court also rejected two other options offered in Justice Marshall’s dissent: (1) paying other workers overtime
wages to induce them to work on Saturdays and making up
for that increased cost by requiring Hardison to work overtime for regular wages at other times and (2) forcing TWA
to pay overtime for Saturday work for three months, after
which, the dissent thought, Hardison could transfer back to
the night shift in Building 1.  The Court dismissed both of
these options as not “feasible,” id., at 83, n. 14, but it provided no explanation for its evaluation of the first.  In dissent, Justice Marshall suggested one possible reason: that
the collective bargaining agreement might have disallowed
Hardison’s working overtime for regular wages.  Id., at 95
(dissenting opinion).  But the majority did not embrace that
explanation.
——————
10 We do not understand Groff to challenge the continued vitality of
Hardison’s core holding on its “principal issue” (bracketing  his disputes
that the memorandum of understanding  set forth a seniority system).
432 U. S., at 83, and n. 14.
As for the second, the Court disputed the dissent’s conclusion that Hardison, if he moved back to Building 1,
would have had enough seniority to choose  to work the
night shift.  Id., at 83, n. 14.  That latter disagreement was
key.  The dissent thought that Hardison could have resumed the night shift in Building 1 after just  three months,
and it therefore calculated what it would have cost TWA to
pay other workers’ overtime wages on Saturdays for that
finite period of time.  According to that calculation, TWA’s
added expense for three months would have been $150
(about $1,250 in 2022 dollars).11   Id., at 92, n. 6.  But the
Court doubted that Hardison could have regained the seniority rights he had enjoyed in Building 1 prior to his transfer, and if that were true, TWA would have been required
to pay other workers overtime for Saturday work indefinitely.  Even under Justice Marshall’s math, that would
have worked out to $600 per year at the time, or roughly
$5,000 per year today.
In the briefs and at argument, little space was devoted to
the question of determining when increased costs amount
to an “undue hardship” under the statute, but a single, but
oft-quoted, sentence in the opinion of the Court, if taken literally, suggested that even a pittance might be too much for
an employer to be forced to endure. The line read as follows:
“To require TWA to bear more than a de minimis cost in
order to give Hardison Saturdays off is an undue hardship.”
Id., at 84.
Although this line would later be viewed by many lower
courts as the authoritative interpretation of the statutory
term “undue hardship,” it is doubtful that it was meant to
take on that large role. In responding to Justice Marshall’s
dissent, the Court described the governing standard quite
——————
11 The dissent appears to have drawn its estimate from Hardison’s
daily rate at the time of termination ($3.37/hour) and deposition testimony on typical overtime rates and shift lengths.  See App. in No. 75–
1126 etc., at pp. 40, 126.
differently, stating three times that an accommodation is
not required when it entails “substantial”  “costs” or “expenditures.”  Id., at 83, n. 14.  This formulation suggests
that an employer may be required to bear costs and make
expenditures that are not “substantial.”  Of course, there is
a big difference between costs and expenditures that are not
“substantial” and those that are “de minimis,” which is to
say, so “very small or trifling” that that they are not even
worth noticing.  Black’s Law Dictionary 388 (5th ed. 1979).
The Court’s response to Justice Marshall’s estimate of the
extra costs that TWA would have been required to foot is
also telling.  The majority did not argue that Justice Marshall’s math produced considerably “more than a de minimis cost” (as it certainly did).  Instead, the Court responded
that Justice Marshall’s calculation involved assumptions
that were not “feasible under the circumstances” and would
have produced a different conflict with “the seniority rights
of other employees.”  432 U. S., at 83, n. 14; see Brief for
United States 29, n. 4 (noting that Hardison “specifically
rejected” the dissent’s calculations and that it is “wrong to
assert” that  Hardison  held that a $150 cost was an undue
hardship).
Ultimately, then, it is not clear that any of the possible
accommodations  would  have  actually  solved  Hardison’s
problem without transgressing seniority rights.  The Hardison Court was very clear that those rights were off-limits.
Its guidance on “undue hardship” in situations not involving seniority rights is much less clear.
C
Even though Hardison’s reference to “de minimis” was
undercut by conflicting language and was fleeting in comparison to its discussion of the “principal issue” of seniority
rights, lower courts have latched on to “de minimis” as the
governing standard.
To be sure, as the Solicitor General notes, some lower
courts have understood that the protection for religious adherents is greater than “more than . . . de minimis” might
suggest when read in isolation.  But a bevy of diverse religious organizations has told this Court that the  de minimis
test has blessed the denial of even  minor accommodation in
many cases, making it harder for members of minority
faiths to enter the job market.  See, e.g., Brief for The Sikh
Coalition et al. as Amici Curiae 15, 19–20 (“the de minimis
standard eliminates any meaningful mandate to accommodate Sikh practices in the workplace” and “emboldens employers to deny reasonable accommodation requests”); Brief
for Council on American-Islamic Relations as Amicus Curiae 3 (Muslim women wearing religiously mandated attire
“have lost employment opportunities” and have been excluded from “critical public institutions like public schools,
law enforcement agencies, and youth rehabilitation centers”); Brief for Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of
America as Amicus Curiae 14–15 (because the “de minimis
cost” test “can be satisfied in nearly any circumstance,” “Orthodox Jews once again [are] left  at the mercy of their employers’  good  graces”);  Brief  for  Seventh-day  Adventist
Church in Canada et al. as Amici Curiae 8 (joint brief of
Sabbatarian faiths arguing that Sabbath accommodation
under the de minimis standard is left to “their employers’
and coworkers’ goodwill”).
The EEOC has also accepted Hardison as prescribing a
“‘more than a de minimis cost’” test, 29 CFR §1605.2(e)(1)
(2022), but has tried in some ways to soften its impact.  It
has specifically cautioned (as has the Solicitor General in
this case) against extending the phrase to cover such things
as the “administrative costs” involved in reworking schedules,  the “infrequent” or temporary “payment of premium
wages for a substitute,” and “voluntary substitutes and
swaps” when they are not contrary  to a “bona fide seniority
system.”  §§1605.2(e)(1), (2).
Nevertheless, some courts have rejected even the EEOC’s
gloss on “de minimis.”12 And in other cases, courts have rejected accommodations that the EEOC’s guidelines consider to be ordinarily required, such as the relaxation of
dress  codes  and  coverage  for  occasional  absences.13
Members of this Court have warned that, if the de minimis rule represents the holding of Hardison, the decision
might have to be reconsidered.  Small v. Memphis Light,
Gas & Water, 593 U. S. ___ (2021) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting
from denial of certiorari); Patterson v. Walgreen Co., 589
U. S. ___ (2020) (ALITO, J., concurring in denial of certiorari).  Four years ago, the Solicitor General—joined on its
brief by the EEOC—likewise took that view.  Brief for
United States as Amicus Curiae in  Patterson  v. Walgreen
Co., O. T. 2019, No. 18–349, p. 20 (“Contrary to Hardison,
therefore, an ‘undue hardship’ is not best interpreted to
mean ‘more than a de minimis cost’”).
Today, the Solicitor General disavows its prior position
that Hardison should be overruled—but only on the understanding that Hardison  does not compel courts to read the

manager’s observance of the Sabbath.  EEOC v. Walmart Stores East, L.

“more than de minimis” standard “literally” or in a manner
that  undermines  Hardison’s  references  to  “substantial”
cost.14  Tr. of Oral Arg. 107.  With the benefit of comprehensive briefing and oral argument, we agree.15
III
We hold that showing “more than a de minimis cost,” as
that phrase is used in common parlance, does not suffice to
establish “undue hardship” under Title VII.  Hardison  cannot be reduced to that one phrase.  In describing an employer’s “undue hardship” defense, Hardison referred repeatedly to “substantial” burdens, and that formulation
better explains the decision. We therefore, like the parties,
understand Hardison to mean that “undue hardship” is
shown when a burden is substantial in the overall context
——————
14 At the certiorari stage, the  Government argued against review by
noting that Government employees receive “at least as much protection
for religious-accommodation claims [under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)] as [under] any interpretation of Title VII.”  Brief in
Opposition 9.  Courts have not always agreed on how RFRA’s cause of
action—which does not rely on employment status—interacts with Title
VII’s cause of action, and the Third Circuit has treated Title VII as exclusively governing at least some employment-related claims brought by
Government employees.  Compare Francis v.  Mineta, 505 F. 3d 266, 271
(CA3 2007), with  Tagore v.  United States, 735 F. 3d 324, 330–331 (CA5
2013) (federal employee’s RFRA claim could proceed even though de minimis standard foreclosed Title VII claim).  Because Groff did not bring a
RFRA claim, we need not resolve today whether the Government is correct that RFRA claims arising out  of federal employment are not displaced by Title VII.
15 In addition to suggesting that Hardison  be revisited, some Justices
have questioned whether Hardison  (which addresses the pre-1972 EEOC
Guidelines) binds courts interpreting the  current version of Title VII.
See Abercrombie, 575 U. S., at 787, n. (THOMAS, J., concurring in part
and dissenting in part).  As explained below, because we—like the Solicitor General—construe Hardison as consistent with the ordinary meaning of “undue hardship,” we need not reconcile any divergence between
Hardison  and the statutory text.
of an employer’s business.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 61–62 (argument of Solicitor General).  This fact-specific inquiry
comports with both Hardison  and the meaning of “undue
hardship” in ordinary speech.
A
As we have explained, we do not write on a blank slate in
determining what an employer must prove to defend a denial of a religious accommodation, but we think it reasonable to begin with Title VII’s text.  After all, as we have
stressed over and over again in recent years, statutory interpretation must “begi[n] with,” and ultimately heed, what
a statute actually says.  National Assn. of Mfrs. v. Department of Defense, 583 U. S. 109, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 15)
(internal  quotation  marks  omitted);  see  Bartenwerfer  v.
Buckley, 598 U. S. 69, 74 (2023); Intel Corp. Investment Policy Comm. v. Sulyma, 589 U. S. ___, ___–___, ___ (2020)
(slip op., at 5–6, 9). Here, the key statutory term is “undue
hardship.”  In common parlance, a “hardship” is, at a minimum, “something hard to bear.” Random House Dictionary
of  the  English  Language  646  (1966)  (Random  House).
Other definitions go further.  See, e.g., Webster’s Third New
International  Dictionary  1033  (1971)  (Webster’s  Third)
(“something that causes or entails suffering or privation”);
American Heritage Dictionary 601 (1969) (American Heritage) (“[e]xtreme privation; adversity; suffering”); Black’s
Law Dictionary, at 646 (“privation, suffering, adversity”).
But under any definition, a hardship is more severe than a
mere burden.  So even if Title VII said only that an employer need not be made to suffer a “hardship,” an employer
could not escape liability simply by showing that an accommodation would impose some sort of additional costs.  Those
costs would have to rise to the level of hardship, and adding
the modifier “undue” means that the requisite burden, privation, or adversity must rise to an “excessive” or “unjustifiable” level. Random House 1547; see,  e.g., Webster’s Third
2492 (“inappropriate,” “unsuited,” or “exceeding or violating
propriety  or  fitness”);  American  Heritage  1398  (“excessive”).  The Government agrees, noting that “‘undue hardship means something greater than hardship.’ ” Brief for
United States 30; see id., at 39 (arguing that “accommodations  should  be  assessed  while  ‘keep[ing]  in  mind  both
words in the key phrase of the actual statutory text: “undue” and “hardship”’” (quoting Adeyeye v. Heartland Sweeteners, LLC, 721 F. 3d 444, 456 (CA7 2013)).
When “undue hardship” is understood in this way, it
means  something  very  different  from  a  burden  that  is
merely more than de minimis, i.e., something that is “very
small or trifling.”  Black’s Law Dictionary, at 388.  So considering  ordinary  meaning  while  taking   Hardison  as  a
given, we are pointed toward something closer to Hardison’s references to “substantial additional costs” or “substantial expenditures.”  432 U. S., at 83, n. 14.
Similarly, while we do not rely on the pre-1972 EEOC decisions described above to define the term, we do observe
that these decisions often found that accommodations that
entailed substantial costs were required.  See supra, at  5,
nn. 3–4.  Nothing in this history plausibly suggests that
“undue hardship” in Title VII should be read to mean anything less than its meaning in ordinary use.  Cf. George v.
McDonough, 596 U. S. ___, ___ (2022) (slip op., at 5) (a “robust regulatory backdrop” can “fil[l] in the details” of a statutory scheme’s use of a specific term).
In short, no factor discussed by the parties—the ordinary
meaning of “undue hardship,” the EEOC guidelines that
Hardison  concluded that the 1972 amendment “ ‘ratified,’ ”
432 U. S., at 76, n. 11 (internal quotation marks omitted),
the use of that term by the EEOC prior to those amendments, and the common use of that term in other statutes—
supports reducing Hardison to its “more than a de minimis
cost” line. See Brief for United States 39 (arguing that “the
Court could emphasize that Hardison’s language does not
displace the statutory standard”).
B
In this case, both parties agree that the “de minimis” test
is not right, but they differ slightly in the alternative language they prefer.  Groff likes the  phrase “significant difficulty or expense.”  Brief for Petitioner 15; Reply Brief 2.
The Government, disavowing its prior position that Title
VII’s text requires overruling Hardison, points us to Hardison’s repeated references to  “substantial expenditures” or
“substantial additional costs.”  Brief for United States 28–
29 (citing 432 U. S., at 83–84, and n. 14); see Brief for
United States 39. We think it is enough to say that an employer must show that the burden of granting an accommodation would result in substantial increased costs in relation to the conduct of its particular business.  Hardison, 432
U. S., at 83, n. 14.
What matters more than a favored synonym for “undue
hardship” (which is the actual text) is that courts must apply the test in a manner that takes into account all relevant
factors in the case at hand, including the particular accommodations at issue and their practical impact in light of the
nature, “size and operating cost of [an] employer.” Brief for
United States 40 (internal quotation marks omitted).
C
The main difference between the parties lies in the further steps they would ask us to take in elaborating upon
their standards. Groff would not simply borrow the phrase
“significant difficulty or expense” from the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) but would have us instruct lower
courts to “draw upon decades of ADA caselaw.”  Reply Brief
13.  The Government, on the other  hand, requests that we
opine that the EEOC’s construction of Hardison has been
basically correct.  Brief for United States 39.
Both of these suggestions go too far. We have no reservations in saying that a good deal of the EEOC’s guidance in
this area is  sensible and will, in all likelihood, be unaffected
by our clarifying decision today.  After all, as a public advocate for employee rights, much of the EEOC’s guidance has
focused on what should be accommodated.  Accordingly,  today’s clarification may prompt little, if any, change in the
agency’s guidance explaining why no undue hardship is imposed by temporary costs, voluntary shift swapping, occasional shift swapping, or administrative costs.  See 29 CFR
§1605.2(d).  But it would not be prudent to ratify in toto a
body of EEOC interpretation that has not had the benefit of
the clarification we adopt today. What is most important is
that “undue hardship” in Title VII means what it says, and
courts should resolve whether a hardship would be substantial in the context of an employer’s business in the commonsense manner that it would use in applying any such test.
D
The  erroneous de minimis interpretation of Hardison
may have had the effect of leading courts to pay insufficient
attention to what the actual text of Title VII means with
regard to several recurring issues. Since we are now brushing away that mistaken view of Hardison’s holding, clarification of some of those issues—in line with the parties’
agreement in this case—is in order.
First,  on  the  second  question  presented,  both  parties
agree that the language of Title VII requires an assessment
of a possible accommodation’s effect on “the conduct of the
employer’s business.”  42 U. S. C. §2000e(j); see 35 F. 4th,
at 177–178 (Hardiman, J., dissenting).  As the Solicitor
General put it, not all “impacts on coworkers . . . are relevant,” but only “coworker impacts” that go on to “affec[t] the
conduct of the business.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. 102–104.  So an
accommodation’s effect on co-workers may have ramifications for the conduct of the employer’s business, but a court
cannot stop its analysis without examining whether that
further logical step is shown in a particular case.
On this point, the Solicitor General took pains to clarify
that some evidence that occasionally is used to show “impacts” on coworkers is “off the table” for consideration.  Id.,
at 102.  Specifically, a coworker’s dislike of “religious practice and expression in the workplace” or “the mere fact [of]
an accommodation” is not “cognizable to factor into the undue hardship inquiry.”  Id., at 89–90.  To the extent that
this was not previously clear, we agree.  An employer who
fails to provide an accommodation has a defense only if the
hardship is “undue,” and a hardship that is attributable to
employee animosity to a particular religion, to religion in
general, or to the very notion of accommodating religious
practice cannot be considered “undue.”  If bias or hostility
to a religious practice or a religious accommodation provided a defense to a reasonable accommodation claim, Title
VII would be at war with itself.  See id., at 89 (argument of
Solicitor General) (such an approach would be “giving effect
to religious hostility”); contra, EEOC v. Sambo’s of Georgia,
Inc., 530 F. Supp. 86, 89 (ND Ga. 1981) (considering as
hardship “[a]dverse customer reaction” from “a simple aversion to, or discomfort in dealing with, bearded people”).
Second, as the Solicitor General’s authorities underscore,
Title VII requires that an employer reasonably accommodate an employee’s practice of religion, not merely that it
assess the reasonableness of a particular possible accommodation or accommodations.  See Adeyeye, 721 F. 3d, at 455;
see also Brief for United States 30, 33, 39.  This distinction
matters.  Faced  with  an  accommodation  request  like
Groff’s, it would not be enough for an employer to conclude
that forcing other employees to work overtime would constitute an undue hardship.  Consideration of other options,
such as voluntary shift swapping, would also be necessary.
IV
Having clarified the Title VII undue-hardship standard,
we think it appropriate to leave the context-specific application of that clarified standard to the lower courts in the
first instance.  The Third Circuit assumed that Hardison
prescribed a “more than a de minimis cost” test, 35 F. 4th,
at 175, and this may have led the court to dismiss a number
of possible accommodations, including those involving the
cost of incentive pay, or the administrative costs of coordination with other nearby stations with a broader set of employees. Without foreclosing the possibility that USPS will
prevail, we think it appropriate to leave it to the lower
courts to apply our clarified context-specific standard, and
to  decide  whether  any  further  factual  development  is
needed.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

No. 22–174

GERALD E. GROFF, PETITIONER v.
LOUIS DEJOY, POSTMASTER GENERAL
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT
[June 29, 2023]
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE JACKSON joins,
concurring.
As both parties here agree, the phrase “more than a de
minimis cost” from Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison,
432 U. S. 63, 84 (1977), was loose language.  An employer
violates Title VII if it fails “to reasonably accommodate” an
employee’s religious observance or practice, unless the employer demonstrates that accommodation would result in
“undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business.”
42 U. S. C. §2000e(j).  The statutory standard is “undue
hardship,” not trivial cost.
Hardison, however, cannot be reduced to its “de minimis”
language. Instead, that case must be understood in light of
its facts and the Court’s reasoning.  The Hardison  Court
concluded  that  the  plaintiff ’s  proposed  accommodation
would have imposed an undue hardship on the conduct of
the employer’s business because the accommodation would
have required the employer either to deprive other employees of their seniority rights under a collective-bargaining
agreement, or to incur substantial additional costs in the
form of lost efficiency or higher wages.  432 U. S., at 79–81,
83–84, and n. 14.  The Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission  has  interpreted  Title  VII’s  undue-hardship
standard in this way for seven consecutive Presidential administrations, from President Reagan to President Biden.
See 29 CFR §1605.2(e) (2022) (citing Hardison, 432 U. S.,
at 80, 84).
Petitioner Gerald Groff asks this Court to overrule Hardison and to replace it with a “significant difficulty or expense” standard.  Brief for Petitioner 17–38.  The Court
does not do so.  That is a wise choice because stare decisis
has “enhanced force” in statutory cases.  Kimble v.  Marvel
Entertainment, LLC, 576 U. S. 446, 456 (2015).  Congress is
free to revise this Court’s statutory interpretations.  The
Court’s respect for Congress’s decision not to intervene promotes the separation of powers by requiring interested parties to resort to the legislative rather than the judicial process to achieve their policy goals.  This justification for
statutory stare decisis is especially strong here because
“Congress has spurned multiple opportunities to reverse
[Hardison]—openings as frequent and clear as this Court
ever sees.” Id., at 456–457.1 Moreover, in the decades since
Hardison was decided,  Congress has revised Title VII multiple times in response to other decisions of this Court,2 yet
never in response to Hardison.  See Kimble, 576 U. S., at
457.

of 2009, 123 Stat. 5 (overruling  Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.,
550 U. S. 618 (2007)).
Groff also asks the Court to decide that Title VII requires
the United States Postal Service to show “undue hardship
to [its] business,” not to Groff ’s co-workers.  Brief for Petitioner 42 (emphasis added); see 35 F. 4th 162, 176 (CA3
2022) (Hardiman, J., dissenting). The Court, however, recognizes that Title VII requires “undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business.” 42 U. S. C. §2000e(j) (emphasis added). Because the “conduct of [a] business” plainly
includes the management and performance of the business’s employees, undue hardship on the conduct of a business may include undue hardship on the business’s employees. See, e.g., Hardison, 432 U. S., at 79–81 (deprivation of
employees’ bargained-for seniority rights constitutes undue
hardship).  There is no basis in the text of the statute, let
alone in economics or common sense, to conclude otherwise.
Indeed, for many businesses, labor is more important to the
conduct of the business than any other factor.
To be sure, some effects on co-workers will not constitute
“undue hardship” under Title VII.  For example, animus toward a protected group is not a cognizable “hardship” under
any antidiscrimination statute. Cf. ante, at 20. In addition,
some hardships, such as the labor costs of coordinating voluntary shift swaps, are not “undue” because they are too
insubstantial.  See 29 CFR §§1605.2(d)(1)(i), (e)(1).  Nevertheless, if there is an undue hardship on “the conduct of the
employer’s business,” 42 U. S. C. §2000e(j), then such hardship is sufficient, even if it consists of hardship on employees.  With these observations, I join the opinion of the
Court.
