GROFF v. DEJOY,  POSTMASTER  GENERAL 
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR 
THE THIRD CIRCUIT  
No. 22–174.  Argued April 18, 2023—Decided June 29, 2023  
Petitioner Gerald Groff is an Evangelical Christian who believes for re-
ligious reasons that Sunday  should be devoted to worship and rest.  In  
2012, Groff took a mail delivery job with the United States Postal Ser-
vice.  Groff’s position generally did not involve Sunday work, but that 
changed after USPS agreed to begin facilitating Sunday deliveries for 
Amazon. To avoid the requirement to work Sundays on a rotating ba-
sis, Groff transferred to a rural USPS station that did not make Sun-
day deliveries. After Amazon deliveries began at that station as well, 
Groff remained unwilling to work Sundays, and USPS redistributed 
Groff’s Sunday deliveries to other USPS staff.  Groff received “progres-
sive discipline” for failing to work on Sundays, and he eventually re-
signed. 
     Groff sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, asserting 
that USPS could have accommodated his Sunday Sabbath practice  
“without undue hardship on the conduct of [USPS’s] business.”  42 
U. S. C. §2000e(j).  The District Court granted summary judgment to 
USPS.  The Third Circuit affirmed based on this Court’s decision in  
Trans World Airlines, Inc.  v. Hardison,  432 U. S. 63, which it con-
strued to mean “that requiring an employer ‘to bear more than a de  
minimis cost’ to provide a religious accommodation is an undue hard-
ship.”  35 F. 4th 162, 174, n. 18 (quoting 432 U. S., at 84).  The Third 
Circuit found the de minimis cost standard met here, concluding that 
exempting Groff from Sunday work had “imposed on his coworkers, 
disrupted the workplace and workflow, and diminished employee mo-
rale.”  35 F. 4th, at 175.   
Held: Title VII requires an employer that denies a religious accommoda-
tion to show that the burden of  granting  an accommodation would re-

sult in substantial increased costs in relation to the conduct of its par-
ticular business.  Pp. 4–21. 
   (a) This case presents the Court’s first opportunity in nearly 50 
years to explain the contours of Hardison.  The background of that de-
cision helps to explain the Court’s disposition of this case.  Pp. 4–15.
     (1) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made it unlawful for 
covered employers “to fail or refuse to  hire or to discharge any individ-
ual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect 
to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges [of] employment, 
because of such individual’s . . . religion.”  §2000e–2(a)(1).  As origi-
nally enacted, Title VII did not spell out what it meant by discrimina-
tion “because of . . . religion.”  Subsequent regulations issued by the 
EEOC obligated employers “to make reasonable accommodations to  
the religious needs of employees” whenever doing so would not create 
“undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business.” 29 CFR 
§1605.1 (1968).  In 1970, however, the Sixth Circuit held that Title VII 
did not require an employer “to accede to or accommodate” a Sabbath 
religious practice because to do so “would raise grave” Establishment 
Clause questions.  Dewey v.  Reynolds Metals Co., 429 F. 2d 324, 334.   
This Court affirmed Dewey by an evenly  divided vote.  See 402 U. S.  
689.  Congress responded by amending Title VII in 1972 to track the 
EEOC’s regulatory language and to clarify that employers must “rea-
sonably accommodate. . . an employee’s or prospective employee’s reli-
gious observance or practice” unless the employer is “unable” to do so  
“without undue hardship on  the conduct of the employer’s business.”  
§2000e(j).  Pp. 4–6. 
  (2) Hardison  concerned an employment dispute that arose prior to 
the 1972 amendments to Title VII.  In 1967, Trans World Airlines  
hired Larry Hardison to work in a department that operated “24 hours 
per day, 365 days per year” and played an “essential role” for TWA by 
providing parts needed to  repair and maintain aircraft.  Hardison, 432  
U. S., at 66.  Hardison later underwent a  religious conversion and be-
gan missing work to observe the Sabbath.  Initial conflicts with Hardi-
son’s work schedule were resolved, but conflicts resurfaced when he  
transferred to another position in which he lacked the seniority to  
avoid work during his Sabbath.  Attempts at accommodation failed,  
and TWA discharged Hardison for insubordination.   
   Hardison sued TWA and his union, and  the Eighth Circuit sided 
with Hardison.  The Eighth  Circuit found that reasonable accommoda-
tions were available to TWA, and rejected the defendants’ Establish-
ment Clause arguments.  Hardison v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 527  
F. 2d 33, 42–44.  This Court granted certiorari.  TWA’s petition for  
certiorari asked this Court to decide whether the 1972 amendment of  
Title VII violated the Establishment Clause as applied by the Eighth

Syllabus  
Circuit, particularly insofar  as that decision had approved an accom-
modation that allegedly overrode seniority rights granted by the rele-
vant collective bargaining agreement.  At the time, some thought that 
the Court’s now-abrogated decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S.  
602—which adopted a test under which any law whose “principal or 
primary effect” “was to advance religion” was unconstitutional, id., at 
612–613—posed a serious problem for the 1972 amendment of Title 
VII.  Ultimately, however,  constitutional concerns played no on-stage 
role in the Court’s decision in Hardison.  Instead, the Court’s opinion 
stated that “the principal issue on which TWA and the union came to 
this Court” was whether Title VII “require[s] an employer and a union 
who have agreed on a seniority system to deprive senior employees of 
their seniority rights in order to accommodate a junior employee’s re-
ligious practices.”  Hardison, 432 U. S., at 83, and n. 14.  The Court  
held that Title VII imposed no such requirement.   Id., at 83, and n. 14.  
This conclusion, the Court found, was  “supported by the fact that sen-
iority systems are afforded special treatment under Title VII itself.”   
Id., at 81.  Applying this interpretation of Title VII and disagreeing 
with the Eighth Circuit’s evaluation of the factual record, the Court  
identified no way in which TWA, without violating seniority rights, 
could have feasibly accommodated Hardison’s request for an exemp-
tion from work on his Sabbath.   
   The parties had not focused on determining when increased costs 
amount to “undue hardship” under Title VII separately from the sen-
iority issue.  But the Court’s opinion in  Hardison  contained this oft-
quoted sentence: “To require TWA to bear  more than a de minimis cost  
in order to  give Hardison Saturdays off is an undue hardship.”  Alt-
hough many lower courts later viewed this line as  the authoritative 
interpretation of the statutory term “undue hardship,” the context ren-
ders that reading doubtful.  In responding to Justice Marshall’s dis-
sent, the Court described the governing standard quite differently, 
stating three times that an accommodation is not required when it en-
tails “substantial”  “costs” or “expenditures.”  Id., at 83, n. 14.  Pp. 6–
12. 
    (3) Even though Hardison’s reference to “de minimis” was under-
cut by  conflicting language and was  fleeting in comparison to its dis-
cussion of the “principal issue” of seniority rights, lower courts have 
latched on to “de minimis”  as the governing standard.  To be sure, 
many courts have understood that  the protection for religious adher-
ents is greater than “more than . . . de minimis” might suggest when 
read in isolation.  But diverse religious groups tell the Court that the 
“de minimis” standard has been used to deny even minor accommoda-
tions.  The EEOC has also accepted Hardison as prescribing a “more 
than a de minimis cost” test, 29 CFR §1605.2(e)(1), though it has tried  
 
4  GROFF v. DEJOY  
   
Syllabus  
to soften its impact, cautioning against extending the phrase to cover 
such things as the “administrative costs” involved in reworking sched-
ules, the “infrequent” or temporary “payment of premium wages for a 
substitute,” and “voluntary substitutes and swaps” when they are not 
contrary to a “bona fide seniority system.”  §§1605.2(e)(1), (2).  Yet 
some courts have rejected even the EEOC’s gloss on “de minimis,” re-
jecting accommodations the EEOC’s guidelines consider to be ordinar-
ily required. The Court agrees with the Solicitor General that Hardi-
son does not compel courts to read the “more than de minimis” 
standard “literally” or in a manner that undermines Hardison’s refer-
ences to “substantial” cost.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 107.  Pp. 12–15. 
   (b) The Court holds that showing “more than a de minimis cost,” as  
that phrase is used in common parlance, does not suffice to establish  
“undue hardship” under Title VII.  Hardison  cannot be reduced to that  
one phrase.  In describing an employer’s “undue hardship” defense,  
Hardison referred repeatedly to “substantial” burdens, and that for-
mulation better explains the decision.  The Court understands Hardi-
son to mean that “undue hardship” is shown  when a burden is sub-
stantial in the overall context of an employer’s business.  This fact-
specific inquiry comports with both Hardison and the meaning of “un-
due hardship” in ordinary speech.  Pp. 15–21. 
     (1) To determine what an employer must prove to defend a denial 
of a religious accommodation under Title VII, the Court begins with  
Title VII's text.  The statutory term, “hardship,” refers to, at a mini-
mum, “something hard to bear” and suggests something  more severe  
than a mere burden.  If Title VII said only that an employer need not 
be made to suffer a “hardship,” an employer could not escape liability 
simply by showing that an accommodation would impose some sort of 
additional costs.  Adding the modifier “undue” means that the requi-
site burden or adversity must rise to an “excessive” or “unjustifiable”  
level.  Understood in this way, “undue hardship” means something 
very different  from a burden  that is merely more than  de minimis, i.e.,  
“very small or trifling.”  The ordinary meaning of “undue hardship” 
thus points toward a standard closer to Hardison’s references to “sub-
stantial additional costs” or  “substantial expenditures.”  432 U. S., at  
83, n. 14. Further, the Court’s reading of the statutory term comports 
with pre-1972 EEOC decisions, so nothing in that history plausibly  
suggests that  “undue hardship” in Title VII should be read to mean  
anything  less  than  its  meaning  in  ordinary  use.    Cf.  George  v.  
McDonough, 596 U. S. ___, ___.  And no support exists in other factors 
discussed by the parties for reducing Hardison to its “more than a de  
minimis  cost” line.  Pp. 16–18.
     (2) The parties agree that the “de minimis” test is not right, but 
they differ in the alternative language they propose.  The Court thinks  
 
  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  5 
 
Syllabus  
it is enough to say that what an employer must show is that the burden 
of granting an accommodation would result in substantial increased 
costs in relation to the conduct of its particular business.   Hardison, 
432 U. S. at 83, n. 14. Courts must apply the test to take into account 
all relevant factors in the case at hand, including the particular accom-
modations at issue and their practical impact in light of the nature, 
size, and operating cost of an employer.  Pp. 18. 
     (3) The Court declines to adopt the elaborations of the applicable 
standard that the parties suggest,  either to incorporate Americans 
with Disabilities Act case law or opine that the EEOC’s construction of 
Hardison  has  been basically correct.  A good deal of the EEOC’s guid-
ance in this area is sensible and will, in all likelihood, be unaffected by 
the Court’s clarifying decision.  But it would not be prudent to ratify  
in toto a body  of EEOC interpretation that has not had the benefit of 
the clarification the Court adopts today.  What is most important is 
that “undue hardship” in Title VII means what it says, and courts  
should resolve whether a hardship would be substantial in the context 
of an employer’s business in the commonsense manner that it would  
use in applying any such test.  Pp. 18–19. 
     (4) The Court also clarifies several recurring issues.  First, as  the 
parties agree, Title VII requires an assessment of a possible accommo-
dation’s effect  on “the conduct of the employer’s business.”  §2000e(j).  
Impacts on coworkers are relevant only to the extent those impacts go 
on to affect the conduct of the business.  A court must analyze whether  
that further logical step is shown.  Further,  a hardship that is attribut-
able to employee animosity to a particular religion, to religion in gen-
eral, or to the very notion of accommodating  religious practice, cannot 
be considered “undue.”  Bias or hostility to a religious practice or ac-
commodation cannot supply  a defense.   
   Second, Title VII requires that an employer “reasonably accommo-
date” an employee’s practice of religion, not merely that it assess the  
reasonableness of a particular possible accommodation or accommoda-
tions.  Faced with an accommodation request like Groff ’s, an employer 
 
must do more  that conclude that forcing other employees to work over-
time would constitute an undue hardship.  Consideration of other op-
tions would also be necessary.  Pp. 19–20. 
   (c) Having clarified the Title VII undue-hardship standard, the 
Court leaves the context-specific application of that clarified standard 
in this case to the lower courts in the first instance.  Pp. 21.

GERALD E. GROFF, PETITIONER v.  
LOUIS DEJOY, POSTMASTER GENERAL  
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 
APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT  
[June 29, 2023] 
JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court. 
  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires employ-
ers to accommodate the religious practice of their employ-
ees unless  doing so would impose an “undue hardship on 
the conduct of the employer’s business.”  78 Stat. 253, as  
amended, 42 U. S. C. §2000e(j).  Based on a line in this 
Court’s decision in Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 
432 U. S. 63, 84 (1977), many lower courts, including the 
Third Circuit below, have interpreted “undue hardship” to 
mean any effort or cost that is “more than . . . de minimis.” 
In this case, however, both parties—the plaintiff-petitioner, 
Gerald Groff, and the defendant-respondent, the Postmas-
ter General, represented by the Solicitor General—agree  
that the de minimis reading of Hardison is a mistake.  With  
the benefit of thorough briefing and oral argument, we to-
day clarify what Title VII requires. 
I 
  Gerald Groff is an Evangelical Christian who believes for 
religious reasons that Sunday should be devoted to worship 
and rest, not “secular labor” and the “transport[ation]” of  
 
2  GROFF v. DEJOY  
   
Opinion of the Court 
worldly “goods.”  App. 294.  In 2012, Groff began his em-
ployment with the United States Postal Service (USPS), 
which has more than 600,000 employees.  He became a Ru-
ral Carrier Associate, a job that required him to assist reg-
ular carriers in the delivery of mail.  When he  took the po-
sition, it generally did not involve Sunday work.  But within  
a few years, that changed.  In 2013, USPS entered into an  
agreement with Amazon to begin facilitating Sunday deliv-
eries, and in 2016, USPS signed a memorandum of under-
standing with the relevant union (the National Rural Let-
ter Carriers’ Association) that set out how Sunday and 
holiday parcel delivery would be handled.  During a 2-
month peak season, each post office would use its own staff 
to deliver packages. At all other times, Sunday and holiday 
deliveries would be carried out by employees (including Ru-
ral Carrier Associates like Groff) working from a “regional 
hub.” For Quarryville, Pennsylvania, where Groff was orig-
inally stationed, the regional hub was the Lancaster Annex.   
  The memorandum specifies the order in which USPS em-
ployees are to be called on for Sunday work outside the peak 
season. First in line are each hub’s “Assistant Rural Carri-
ers”— part-time employees who are assigned to the hub and 
cover only Sundays and holidays.  Second are any volun-
teers from the geographic area, who are assigned on a ro-
tating basis. And third are all other carriers, who are com-
pelled to do the work on a rotating basis.  Groff fell into this  
third category, and after the memorandum of understand-
ing was adopted, he was told that he would be required to 
work on Sunday.  He then sought and received a transfer to 
Holtwood, a small rural USPS station that had only seven 
employees and that, at the time, did not make Sunday de-
liveries.  But in March 2017, Amazon deliveries  began there 
as well.  
  With Groff unwilling to work on Sundays, USPS made 
other arrangements.  During the peak season, Sunday de-
liveries that would have otherwise been performed by Groff 
 
  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  3 
 
Opinion of the Court 
were carried out by the rest of the Holtwood staff, including 
the postmaster, whose job ordinarily does not involve deliv-
ering mail.  During other months, Groff ’s Sunday assign-
 
ments were redistributed to other carriers assigned to the 
regional hub.1  Throughout this time, Groff continued to re-
ceive “progressive discipline” for failing to work on Sun-
days.  35 F. 4th 162, 166 (CA3 2022).  Finally, in January 
2019, he resigned.2   
  A few months later, Groff sued under Title VII, asserting 
that USPS could have accommodated his Sunday Sabbath 
practice  “without  undue  hardship  on  the  conduct  of 
[USPS’s] business.”  42 U. S. C. §2000e(j).  The District 
Court  granted  summary  judgment  to  USPS,  2021  WL 
1264030 (ED Pa., Apr. 6, 2021), and the Third Circuit af-
firmed.  The panel majority felt that it was “bound by [the] 
ruling” in Hardison, which it construed to mean “that re-
quiring an employer ‘to bear more than a de minimis cost’ 
to provide a religious accommodation is an undue hard-
ship.”  35 F. 4th, at 174, n. 18 (quoting 432 U. S., at 84).  
Under Circuit precedent, the panel observed, this was “not 
a difficult threshold to pass,” 35 F. 4th, at 174 (internal quo-
tation marks omitted), and it held that this low standard
was met in this case.   Exempting Groff from Sunday work, 
the panel found, had “imposed on his coworkers, disrupted 
—————— 
1 Other employees complained about the consequences of Groff ’s ab-
   
sences.  While the parties dispute some of the details, it appears uncon-
tested that at least one employee filed a grievance asserting a conflict 
with his contractual rights.  After disputing any conflict with contract 
rights, USPS eventually settled that claim, with the settlement reaffirm-
ing USPS’s commitment to the Memorandum of Understanding.  App.
118, 125–126. 
2 Groff represents that his resignation was in light of expected termi-
 
nation, and the District Court found “a genuine issue of material fact” 
foreclosed summary judgment as to whether Groff suffered an adverse 
employment action.  2021 WL 1264030,*8 (ED Pa., Apr.  6, 2021).  The 
Government does not dispute the point in this Court.

the workplace and workflow, and diminished employee mo-
rale.”  Id., at 175.  Judge Hardiman dissented, concluding 
that adverse “effects on USPS employees in Lancaster or 
Holtwood” did not alone suffice to show the needed hard-
ship “on the employer’s business.”   Id., at 177 (emphasis in 
original).
  We granted Groff ’s ensuing petition for a writ of certio-
 
rari.  598 U. S. ___ (2023).

  Because this case presents our first opportunity in nearly 
50 years to explain the contours of Hardison, we begin by 
recounting the legal backdrop to that case, including the de-
velopment of the Title VII provision barring religious dis-
crimination and the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission’s  (EEOC’s)  regulations  and  guidance  regarding 
that prohibition.  We then summarize how the Hardison  
case progressed to final decision, and finally, we discuss 
how courts and the EEOC have understood its significance.  
This background helps to explain the clarifications we offer
today.  
A 
  Since its passage, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
has made it unlawful for covered employers “to fail or refuse 
to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to dis-
criminate against any individual with respect to his com-
pensation, terms, conditions, or privileges [of] employment, 
because of such individual’s . . . religion.”  42 U. S. C.  
§2000e–2(a)(1) (1964 ed.).  As originally enacted, Title VII 
did not spell out what it meant by discrimination “because 
of . . . religion,” but shortly after the statute’s passage, the 
EEOC interpreted that provision to mean that employers 
were sometimes required to “accommodate” the “reasonable 
religious needs of employees.” 29 CFR § 1605.1(a)(2) (1967).  
After some tinkering, the EEOC settled on a formulation 
 
  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  5 
 
Opinion of the Court 
that obligated employers “to make reasonable accommoda-
tions to the religious needs of employees” whenever that 
would not work an “undue hardship on the conduct of the 
employer’s business.”  29 CFR § 1605.1 (1968).
  Between 1968 and 1972, the EEOC elaborated on its un-
derstanding of “undue hardship” in a “long line of decisions” 
addressing a variety of policies.  Hardison, 432 U. S., at 85  
(Marshall, J., dissenting); see Brief for General Conference 
of Seventh-day Adventists as Amicus Curiae 10–22 (collect-
ing decisions).  Those decisions addressed many accommo-
dation issues that still arise frequently today, including the 
wearing of religious garb3 and time off from work to attend  
to religious obligations.4     
  EEOC decisions did not settle the question of undue hard-
ship.  In 1970, the Sixth Circuit held (in a Sabbath case) 
that Title VII as then written did not require an employer 
—————— 
3 See, e.g., EEOC Dec. No. 71–779, 1970 WL 3550, *2 (Dec. 21, 1970) 
 
(no undue hardship in permitting nurse to wear religious headscarf). 
4See EEOC Dec. No. 71–463, 1970 WL 3544, *1–*2 (Nov. 13, 1970) (no 
 
“undue hardship” or “unreasonable burde[n]” for employer to train co-
worker to cover two-week religious absence); EEOC Dec. No. 70–580,  
1970 WL 3513, *1–*2 (Mar. 2, 1970) (manufacturing employer asked to  
accommodate sundown-to-sundown Sabbath observance  did not carry  
“burden . . . to demonstrate undue hardship” where it did not address 
“whether another employee could be trained to substitute for the Charg-
ing Party during Sabbath days, or  whether already qualified personnel 
ha[d] been invited to work a double shift”); EEOC Dec. No. 70–670, 1970 
WL 3518, *2 (Mar. 30, 1970) (no “undue  ‘hardship’ ” in having other em-
 
ployees take on a few more on-call Saturdays per year); see also EEOC 
Dec. No. 70–110, 1969 WL 2908, *1–*2 (Aug. 27, 1969) (employer could 
not deny employee all Sunday “overtime opportunities” on basis of em-
ployee’s religious inability to work Saturday, where others not working 
the full weekend had been accommodated, notwithstanding employer’s 
claim of “considerable expense”); EEOC Dec. No. 70–99, 1969 WL 2905,  
*1 (Aug. 27, 1969) (no obligation to accommodate seasonal employee un-
available for Saturday work, where employer showed both “no available 
pool of qualified employees” to substitute and a “practical impossibility

“to accede to or accommodate” religious practice because 
that “would raise grave” Establishment Clause questions.  
Dewey v. Reynolds Metals Co., 429 F. 2d 324, 334.  This 
Court granted certiorari, 400 U. S. 1008, but then affirmed 
by an evenly divided vote, 402 U. S. 689 (1971). 
  Responding to Dewey and another decision rejecting any 
duty to accommodate an employee’s observance of the Sab-
bath, Congress amended Title VII in 1972.  Hardison, 432 
U. S., at 73–74; id., at 88–89 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  
Tracking the EEOC’s regulatory language, Congress pro-
vided that “[t]he term ‘religion’ includes all aspects of reli-
gious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an  
employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably ac-
commodate to an employee’s or prospective employee’s reli-
gious observance or practice without undue hardship on the 
conduct of the employer’s business.”  42 U. S. C. §2000e(j) 
(1970 ed., Supp. II). 
B 
The Hardison case concerned a dispute that arose during 
the interval between the issuance of the EEOC’s ”undue  
hardship” regulation and the 1972 amendment to Title VII.  
In 1967, Larry Hardison was hired as a clerk at the Stores 
Department in the Kansas City base of Trans World Air-
lines (TWA).  The Stores Department was responsible for

(WD Mo. 1974).  It played an “essential role” and operated 
“24 hours per day, 365 days per year.”  Hardison, 432 U. S., 
at 66. After taking this job, Hardison underwent a religious 
conversion.  He began to observe the Sabbath by absenting
himself from work from sunset on Friday to sunset on Sat-
urday, and this conflicted with his work schedule.  The 
problem was solved for a time when Hardison, who worked 
in Building 1, switched to the night shift, but it resurfaced 
when he sought and obtained a transfer to the day shift in

Opinion of the Court 
Building 2 so that he could spend evenings with his wife.  
375 F. Supp., at 889.  In that new building, he did not have 
enough seniority to avoid work during his Sabbath.  At-
tempts at accommodation failed, and he was eventually 
“discharged on grounds of insubordination.”  432 U. S., at 
69. 
  Hardison sued TWA and his union, the International As-
sociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM).5  The  
Eighth Circuit found that reasonable accommodations were 
available, and it rejected the defendants’ Establishment 
Clause arguments.  Hardison  v.  Trans World Airlines, Inc.,  
527 F. 2d 33, 42–44 (1975).
  Both TWA and IAM then filed petitions for certiorari,  
with  TWA’s  lead  petition  asking  this  Court  to  decide 
whether the 1972 amendment of Title VII violated the Es-
tablishment Clause as applied in the decision  below, partic-
ularly insofar as that decision had approved an accommo-
dation that allegedly overrode seniority rights granted by  
the relevant collective bargaining agreement.6  The Court 
granted both petitions. 429 U. S. 958 (1976).
  When the Court took that action, all counsel had good 
reason to expect that the Establishment Clause would fig-
ure prominently in the Court’s analysis.  As noted above, in  
June 1971, the Court, by an equally divided vote, had af-
firmed the Sixth Circuit’s decision in Dewey, which had 
heavily relied on Establishment Clause avoidance to reject 
the interpretation of Title VII set out in the EEOC’s reason-
able-accommodation  guidelines.    Just  over  three  weeks 
later, the Court had handed down its (now abrogated)7 de-
cision in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971) which

8  GROFF v. DEJOY  
   
Opinion of the Court 
adopted a test under which any law whose “principal or pri-
mary  effect”  “was  to  advance  religion”  was  unconstitu-
tional.  Id., at 612–613.  Because it could be argued that 
granting a special accommodation to a religious practice 
had just such a purpose and effect, some thought that  
Lemon posed a serious problem for the 1972 amendment of 
Title VII. And shortly before review was granted in Hardi-
son, the Court had announced that the Justices were evenly 
divided in a case that challenged the 1972 amendment as a 
violation of  the Establishment Clause.  Parker Seal Co. v.  
Cummins, 429 U. S. 65 (1976) (per curiam).  
  Against this backdrop, both TWA and IAM challenged
the constitutionality of requiring any accommodation for re-
ligious practice. The Summary of Argument in TWA’s brief 
began with this categorical assertion: “The religious accom-
modation requirement of Title VII violates the Establish-
ment Clause of the First Amendment.”  Brief for Petitioner 
TWA in O. T. 1976, No. 75–1126, p.  19.  Applying the three-
part Lemon test, TWA argued that any such accommoda-
tion has the primary purpose and effect of advancing reli-
gion and entails “pervasive” government “entanglement . . . 
in religious issues.”  Brief for Petitioner TWA in No. 75– 
1126, at 20.  The union’s brief made a similar argument, 
Brief for Petitioner IAM, O. T. 1976, No. 75–1126, pp. 21–
24, 50–72, but stressed the special status of seniority rights 
under Title VII, id., at 24–36. 
  Despite the prominence of the Establishment Clause in 
the briefs submitted by the parties and their amici,8 consti-
tutional concerns played no on-stage role in the Court’s  
opinion, which focused instead on seniority rights.9  The

opinion stated that “the principal issue on which TWA and 
the union came to this Court”  was whether Title VII “re-
quire[s] an employer and a union who have agreed on a sen-
iority system to deprive senior employees of their seniority 
rights in order to accommodate a junior employee’s reli-
gious practices.” 432 U. S., at 83, and n. 14.  The Court held  
that Title VII imposed no such requirement.  Ibid.  This  
conclusion, the Court found, was “supported by the fact that 
seniority systems are afforded special treatment under Ti-
tle VII itself.”  Id., at 81.  It noted that Title VII expressly 
provides special protection for “‘bona fide seniority . . . sys-
 
tem[s],’” id., at 81–82 (quoting 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(h)), and

ordinary meaning of “undue hardship” and “more than . . . de minimis”  
led some to interpret the decision to rest on Establishment Clause con-
cerns.  Justice Marshall observed in his  Hardison dissent that the ma-
jority opinion “ha[d] the singular advantage of making consideration of 
petitioners’ constitutional challenge unnecessary.”  432 U. S., at 89.  A  
few  courts  assumed  that  Hardison  actually  was  an  Establishment 
Clause decision. See,  e.g., Gibson v.  Missouri Pacific R. Co., 620 F. Supp. 
85, 88–89 (ED Ark. 1985) (concluding that requiring an employer to “in-
cur  greater than de minimis costs” related to accommodating a Sabbath 
“would therefore violate the establishment clause”); see also Massachu-
setts Bay Transp. Auth.  v.  Massachusetts Comm’n Against Discrimina-
tion, 450 Mass. 327, 340–341, and n.  15, 879 N. E. 2d 36, 46–48, and n.15  
(2008) (construing state law narrowly on premise that Hardison might 
state outer  constitutional bounds).  Some constitutional scholars also  
suggested that  Hardison must have been based on constitutional avoid-
ance. See, e.g., P. Karlan & G. Rutherglen, Disabilities, Discrimination, 
and  Reasonable  Accommodation,  46  Duke  L.  J.  1,  6–7  (1996);  M.  
McConnell, Accommodation of Religion: An Update and a Response to  
the Critics, 60 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 685, 704 (1992); cf. Small v.  Memphis  
Light, Gas & Water, 952 F. 3d 821, 829 (CA6 2020) (Thapar, J., concur-
ring). In doing so, some have pointed to Hardison’s passing reference to 
a need to avoid “unequal treatment  of employees on the basis of their 
religion.”  432 U. S., at 84.  But the Court later clarified that “Title VII  
does not demand mere neutrality with regard to religious practices” but 
instead “gives them favored treatment” in order to ensure religious per-
sons’ full participation in the workforce.  EEOC v.  Abercrombie & Fitch  
Stores, Inc., 575 U. S. 768, 775 (2015).   
 
10  GROFF v. DEJOY  
   
Opinion of the Court 
the routine application of a bona fide seniority system [is] 
not . . . unlawful under Title VII.’”  432 U. S., at 82 (quoting 
 
Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 352 (1977)).  In-
voking these authorities, the Court found that the statute 
did not require an accommodation that involuntarily de-
prived employees of seniority rights.  432 U. S., at 80.10     
  Applying this interpretation of Title VII and disagreeing 
with the Eighth Circuit’s evaluation of the factual record, 
the Court identified no way in which TWA, without violat-
ing  seniority  rights,  could  have  feasibly  accommodated 
Hardison’s request for an exemption from work on his Sab-
bath.  The Court found that not enough co-workers were  
willing to take Hardison’s shift voluntarily, that compelling 
them to do so would have violated their seniority rights, and 
that leaving the Stores Department short-handed would 
have adversely affected its “essential” mission.  Id., at 68,  
80. 
  The Court also rejected two other options offered in Jus-
tice Marshall’s dissent: (1) paying other workers overtime 
wages to induce them to work on Saturdays and making up 
for that increased cost by requiring Hardison to work over-
time for regular wages at other times and (2) forcing TWA 
to pay overtime for Saturday work for three months, after 
which, the dissent thought, Hardison could transfer back to 
the night shift in Building 1.  The Court dismissed both of  
these options as not “feasible,” id., at 83, n. 14, but it pro-
vided no explanation for its evaluation of the first.  In dis-
sent, Justice Marshall suggested one possible reason: that 
the collective bargaining agreement might have disallowed 
Hardison’s working overtime for regular wages.  Id., at 95 
(dissenting opinion).  But the majority did not embrace that 
explanation.

Hardison’s core holding on its “principal issue” (bracketing  his disputes

432 U. S., at 83, and n. 14.   
 
  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  11  
 
Opinion of the Court 
  As for the second, the Court disputed the dissent’s con-
clusion that Hardison, if he moved back to Building 1, 
would have had enough seniority to choose  to work the  
night shift.  Id., at 83, n. 14.  That latter disagreement was 
key.  The dissent thought that Hardison could have re-
sumed the night shift in Building 1 after just  three months, 
and it therefore calculated what it would have cost TWA to  
pay other workers’ overtime wages on Saturdays for that 
finite period of time.  According to that calculation, TWA’s 
added expense for three months would have been $150 
(about $1,250 in 2022 dollars).11   Id., at 92, n. 6.  But the 
Court doubted that Hardison could have regained the sen-
iority rights he had enjoyed in Building 1 prior to his trans-
fer, and if that were true, TWA would have been required
to pay other workers overtime for Saturday work indefi-
nitely.  Even under Justice Marshall’s math, that would 
have worked out to $600 per year at the time, or roughly 
$5,000 per year today.   
  In the briefs and at argument, little space was devoted to 
the question of determining when increased costs amount  
to an “undue hardship” under the statute, but a single, but 
oft-quoted, sentence in the opinion of the Court, if taken lit-
erally, suggested that even a pittance might be too much for 
an employer to be forced to endure. The line read as follows: 
“To require TWA to bear more than a de minimis cost in  
order to give Hardison Saturdays off is an undue hardship.”  
Id., at 84.   
  Although this line would later be viewed by many lower 
courts as the authoritative interpretation of the statutory 
term “undue hardship,” it is doubtful that it was meant to 
take on that large role. In responding to Justice Marshall’s 
dissent, the Court described the governing standard quite  
—————— 
11 The dissent appears to have drawn its estimate from Hardison’s 
 
daily rate at the time of termination ($3.37/hour) and deposition testi-
mony on typical overtime rates and shift lengths.  See App. in No. 75– 
1126 etc., at pp. 40, 126.  
 
12  GROFF v. DEJOY  
   
Opinion of the Court 
differently, stating three times that an accommodation is 
not required when it entails “substantial”  “costs” or “ex-
penditures.”  Id., at 83, n. 14.  This formulation suggests 
that an employer may be required to bear costs and make 
expenditures that are not “substantial.”  Of course, there is  
a big difference between costs and expenditures that are not 
“substantial” and those that are “de minimis,” which is to 
say, so “very small or trifling” that that they are not even 
worth noticing.  Black’s Law Dictionary 388 (5th ed. 1979).   
  The Court’s response to Justice Marshall’s estimate of the 
extra costs that TWA would have been required to foot is 
also telling.  The majority did not argue that Justice Mar-
shall’s math produced considerably “more than a de mini-
mis cost” (as it certainly did).  Instead, the Court responded 
that Justice Marshall’s calculation involved assumptions
that were not “feasible under the circumstances” and would 
have produced a different conflict with “the seniority rights 
of other employees.”  432 U. S., at 83, n. 14; see Brief for 
United States 29, n. 4 (noting that Hardison “specifically 
rejected” the dissent’s calculations and that it is “wrong to 
assert” that  Hardison  held that a $150 cost was an undue 
hardship).
  Ultimately, then, it is not clear that any of the possible 
accommodations  would  have  actually  solved  Hardison’s 
problem without transgressing seniority rights.  The Har-
dison Court was very clear that those rights were off-limits.  
Its guidance on “undue hardship” in situations not involv-
ing seniority rights is much less clear.   
C 
  Even though Hardison’s reference to “de minimis” was  
undercut by conflicting language and was fleeting in com-
parison to its discussion of the “principal issue” of seniority 
rights, lower courts have latched on to “de minimis” as the 
governing standard. 
  To be sure, as the Solicitor General notes, some lower 
 
  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  13  
 
Opinion of the Court 
courts have understood that the protection for religious ad-
herents is greater than “more than . . . de minimis” might 
suggest when read in isolation.  But a bevy of diverse reli-
gious organizations has told this Court that the  de minimis  
test has blessed the denial of even  minor accommodation in  
many cases, making it harder for members of minority
faiths to enter the job market.  See, e.g., Brief for The Sikh 
Coalition et al. as Amici Curiae 15, 19–20 (“the de minimis 
standard eliminates any meaningful mandate to accommo-
date Sikh practices in the workplace” and “emboldens em-
ployers to deny reasonable accommodation requests”); Brief 
for Council on American-Islamic Relations as Amicus Cu-
riae 3 (Muslim women wearing religiously mandated attire  
“have lost employment opportunities” and have been ex-
cluded from “critical public institutions like public schools, 
law enforcement agencies, and youth rehabilitation cen-
ters”); Brief for Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of 
America as Amicus Curiae 14–15 (because the “de minimis  
cost” test “can be satisfied in nearly any circumstance,” “Or-
thodox Jews once again [are] left  at the mercy of their em-
ployers’  good  graces”);  Brief  for  Seventh-day  Adventist 
Church in Canada et al. as Amici Curiae 8 (joint brief of 
Sabbatarian faiths arguing that Sabbath accommodation 
under the de minimis standard is left to “their employers’
and coworkers’ goodwill”).
  The EEOC has also accepted Hardison as prescribing a 
“‘more than a de minimis cost’” test, 29 CFR §1605.2(e)(1) 
   
(2022), but has tried in some ways to soften its impact.  It  
has specifically cautioned (as has the Solicitor General in 
this case) against extending the phrase to cover such things 
as the “administrative costs” involved in reworking sched-
ules,  the “infrequent” or temporary “payment of premium 
wages for a substitute,” and “voluntary substitutes and
swaps” when they are not contrary  to a “bona fide seniority 
system.”  §§1605.2(e)(1), (2).
  Nevertheless, some courts have rejected even the EEOC’s  
 
14  GROFF v. DEJOY  
   
Opinion of the Court 
gloss on “de minimis.”12 And in other cases, courts have re-
jected accommodations that the EEOC’s guidelines con-
sider to be ordinarily required, such as the relaxation of 
dress  codes  and  coverage  for  occasional  absences.13   
  Members of this Court have warned that, if the de mini-
mis rule represents the holding of Hardison, the decision 
might have to be reconsidered.  Small v. Memphis Light, 
Gas & Water, 593 U. S. ___ (2021) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting 
from denial of certiorari); Patterson v. Walgreen Co., 589 
U. S. ___ (2020) (ALITO, J., concurring in denial of certio-
rari).  Four years ago, the Solicitor General—joined on its 
brief by the EEOC—likewise took that view.  Brief for 
United States as Amicus Curiae in  Patterson  v. Walgreen  
Co., O. T. 2019, No. 18–349, p. 20 (“Contrary to Hardison, 
therefore, an ‘undue hardship’ is not best interpreted to 
mean ‘more than a de minimis cost’”).

standing that Hardison  does not compel courts to read the

“more than de minimis” standard “literally” or in a manner  
that  undermines  Hardison’s  references  to  “substantial” 
cost.14  Tr. of Oral Arg. 107.  With the benefit of comprehen-
sive briefing and oral argument, we agree.15  
III  
  We hold that showing “more than a de minimis cost,” as  
that phrase is used in common parlance, does not suffice to 
establish “undue hardship” under Title VII.  Hardison  can-
not be reduced to that one phrase.  In describing an em-
ployer’s “undue hardship” defense, Hardison referred re-
peatedly to “substantial” burdens, and that formulation 
better explains the decision. We therefore, like the parties, 
understand Hardison to mean that “undue hardship” is
shown when a burden is substantial in the overall context 
—————— 
14 At the certiorari stage, the  Government argued against review by 
 
noting that Government employees receive “at least as much protection 
for religious-accommodation claims [under the Religious Freedom Resto-
ration Act (RFRA)] as [under] any interpretation of Title VII.”  Brief in  
Opposition 9.  Courts have not always agreed on how RFRA’s cause of 
action—which does not rely on employment status—interacts with Title 
VII’s cause of action, and the Third Circuit has treated Title VII as ex-
clusively governing at least some employment-related claims brought by 
Government employees.  Compare Francis v.  Mineta, 505 F. 3d 266, 271  
(CA3 2007), with  Tagore v.  United States, 735 F. 3d 324, 330–331 (CA5 
2013) (federal employee’s RFRA claim could proceed even though de min-
imis standard foreclosed Title VII claim).  Because Groff did not bring a 
RFRA claim, we need not resolve today whether the Government is cor-
rect that RFRA claims arising out  of federal employment are not dis-
placed by Title VII. 
15 In addition to suggesting that Hardison  be revisited, some Justices  
 
have questioned whether Hardison  (which addresses the pre-1972 EEOC 
Guidelines) binds courts interpreting the  current version of Title VII.   
See Abercrombie, 575 U. S., at 787, n. (THOMAS, J., concurring in part  
and dissenting in part).  As explained below, because we—like the Solic-
itor General—construe Hardison as consistent with the ordinary mean-
ing of “undue hardship,” we need not reconcile any divergence between 
Hardison  and the statutory text. 
 
16  GROFF v. DEJOY  
   
Opinion of the Court 
of an employer’s business.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 61–62 (ar-
gument of Solicitor General).  This fact-specific inquiry 
comports with both Hardison  and the meaning of “undue  
hardship” in ordinary speech.     
A 
  As we have explained, we do not write on a blank slate in 
determining what an employer must prove to defend a de-
nial of a religious accommodation, but we think it reasona-
ble to begin with Title VII’s text.  After all, as we have  
stressed over and over again in recent years, statutory in-
terpretation must “begi[n] with,” and ultimately heed, what 
a statute actually says.  National Assn. of Mfrs. v. Depart-
ment of Defense, 583 U. S. 109, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 15) 
(internal  quotation  marks  omitted);  see  Bartenwerfer  v. 
Buckley, 598 U. S. 69, 74 (2023); Intel Corp. Investment Pol-
icy Comm. v. Sulyma, 589 U. S. ___, ___–___, ___ (2020)
(slip op., at 5–6, 9). Here, the key statutory term is “undue 
hardship.”  In common parlance, a “hardship” is, at a mini-
mum, “something hard to bear.” Random House Dictionary
of  the  English  Language  646  (1966)  (Random  House).  
Other definitions go further.  See, e.g., Webster’s Third New 
International  Dictionary  1033  (1971)  (Webster’s  Third) 
(“something that causes or entails suffering or privation”); 
American Heritage Dictionary 601 (1969) (American Herit-
age) (“[e]xtreme privation; adversity; suffering”); Black’s 
Law Dictionary, at 646 (“privation, suffering, adversity”).  
But under any definition, a hardship is more severe than a 
mere burden.  So even if Title VII said only that an em-
ployer need not be made to suffer a “hardship,” an employer 
could not escape liability simply by showing that an accom-
modation would impose some sort of additional costs.  Those 
costs would have to rise to the level of hardship, and adding 
the modifier “undue” means that the requisite burden, pri-
vation, or adversity must rise to an “excessive” or “unjusti-
fiable” level. Random House 1547; see,  e.g., Webster’s Third  
 
  Cite as:  600 U. S. ____ (2023)  17  
 
Opinion of the Court 
2492 (“inappropriate,” “unsuited,” or “exceeding or violating 
propriety  or  fitness”);  American  Heritage  1398  (“exces-
sive”).  The Government agrees, noting that “‘undue hard-
 
ship means something greater than hardship.’ ” Brief for 
 
United States 30; see id., at 39 (arguing that “accommoda-
tions  should  be  assessed  while  ‘keep[ing]  in  mind  both 
words in the key phrase of the actual statutory text: “un-
due” and “hardship”’” (quoting Adeyeye v. Heartland Sweet-
  
eners, LLC, 721 F. 3d 444, 456 (CA7 2013)). 
  When “undue hardship” is understood in this way, it
means  something  very  different  from  a  burden  that  is 
merely more than de minimis, i.e., something that is “very
small or trifling.”  Black’s Law Dictionary, at 388.  So con-
sidering  ordinary  meaning  while  taking   Hardison  as  a 
given, we are pointed toward something closer to Hardi-
son’s references to “substantial additional costs” or “sub-
stantial expenditures.”  432 U. S., at 83, n. 14. 
  Similarly, while we do not rely on the pre-1972 EEOC de-
cisions described above to define the term, we do observe  
that these decisions often found that accommodations that 
entailed substantial costs were required.  See supra, at  5, 
nn. 3–4.  Nothing in this history plausibly suggests that 
“undue hardship” in Title VII should be read to mean any-
thing less than its meaning in ordinary use.  Cf. George v.  
McDonough, 596 U. S. ___, ___ (2022) (slip op., at 5) (a “ro-
bust regulatory backdrop” can “fil[l] in the details” of a stat-
utory scheme’s use of a specific term). 
  In short, no factor discussed by the parties—the ordinary 
meaning of “undue hardship,” the EEOC guidelines that 
Hardison  concluded that the 1972 amendment “ ‘ratified,’ ” 
   
432 U. S., at 76, n. 11 (internal quotation marks omitted), 
the use of that term by the EEOC prior to those amend-
ments, and the common use of that term in other statutes— 
supports reducing Hardison to its “more than a de minimis  
cost” line. See Brief for United States 39 (arguing that “the 
Court could emphasize that Hardison’s language does not 
 
18  GROFF v. DEJOY  
   
Opinion of the Court 
displace the statutory standard”). 
B 
  In this case, both parties agree that the “de minimis” test  
is not right, but they differ slightly in the alternative lan-
guage they prefer.  Groff likes the  phrase “significant diffi-
culty or expense.”  Brief for Petitioner 15; Reply Brief 2.  
The Government, disavowing its prior position that Title 
VII’s text requires overruling Hardison, points us to Hardi-
son’s repeated references to  “substantial expenditures” or 
“substantial additional costs.”  Brief for United States 28– 
29 (citing 432 U. S., at 83–84, and n. 14); see Brief for
United States 39. We think it is enough to say that an em-
ployer must show that the burden of granting an accommo-
dation would result in substantial increased costs in rela-
tion to the conduct of its particular business.  Hardison, 432 
U. S., at 83, n. 14.   
  What matters more than a favored synonym for “undue 
hardship” (which is the actual text) is that courts must ap-
ply the test in a manner that takes into account all relevant 
factors in the case at hand, including the particular accom-
modations at issue and their practical impact in light of the 
nature, “size and operating cost of [an] employer.” Brief for 
United States 40 (internal quotation marks omitted).  
C 
  The main difference between the parties lies in the fur-
ther steps they would ask us to take in elaborating upon 
their standards. Groff would not simply borrow the phrase 
“significant difficulty or expense” from the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA) but would have us instruct lower 
courts to “draw upon decades of ADA caselaw.”  Reply Brief 
13.  The Government, on the other  hand, requests that we 
opine that the EEOC’s construction of Hardison has been 
basically correct.  Brief for United States 39.

Opinion of the Court 
  Both of these suggestions go too far. We have no reserva-
tions in saying that a good deal of the EEOC’s guidance in 
this area is  sensible and will, in all likelihood, be unaffected 
by our clarifying decision today.  After all, as a public advo-
cate for employee rights, much of the EEOC’s guidance has 
focused on what should be accommodated.  Accordingly,  to-
day’s clarification may prompt little, if any, change in the 
agency’s guidance explaining why no undue hardship is im-
posed by temporary costs, voluntary shift swapping, occa-
sional shift swapping, or administrative costs.  See 29 CFR 
§1605.2(d).  But it would not be prudent to ratify in toto a 
body of EEOC interpretation that has not had the benefit of 
the clarification we adopt today. What is most important is 
that “undue hardship” in Title VII means what it says, and 
courts should resolve whether a hardship would be substan-
tial in the context of an employer’s business in the common-
sense manner that it would use in applying any such test.  
D 
The  erroneous de minimis interpretation of Hardison  
may have had the effect of leading courts to pay insufficient 
attention to what the actual text of Title VII means with  
regard to several recurring issues. Since we are now brush-
ing away that mistaken view of Hardison’s holding, clarifi-
cation of some of those issues—in line with the parties’ 
agreement in this case—is in order.
  First,  on  the  second  question  presented,  both  parties 
agree that the language of Title VII requires an assessment
of a possible accommodation’s effect on “the conduct of the 
employer’s business.”  42 U. S. C. §2000e(j); see 35 F. 4th, 
at 177–178 (Hardiman, J., dissenting).  As the Solicitor 
General put it, not all “impacts on coworkers . . . are rele-
vant,” but only “coworker impacts” that go on to “affec[t] the 
conduct of the business.”  Tr. of Oral Arg. 102–104.  So an  
accommodation’s effect on co-workers may have ramifica-
tions for the conduct of the employer’s business, but a court  
 
20  GROFF v. DEJOY  
   
Opinion of the Court 
cannot stop its analysis without examining whether that
further logical step is shown in a particular case.  
  On this point, the Solicitor General took pains to clarify 
that some evidence that occasionally is used to show “im-
pacts” on coworkers is “off the table” for consideration.  Id., 
at 102.  Specifically, a coworker’s dislike of “religious prac-
tice and expression in the workplace” or “the mere fact [of] 
an accommodation” is not “cognizable to factor into the un-
due hardship inquiry.”  Id., at 89–90.  To the extent that 
this was not previously clear, we agree.  An employer who 
fails to provide an accommodation has a defense only if the 
hardship is “undue,” and a hardship that is attributable to 
employee animosity to a particular religion, to religion in  
general, or to the very notion of accommodating religious 
practice cannot be considered “undue.”  If bias or hostility
to a religious practice or a religious accommodation pro-
vided a defense to a reasonable accommodation claim, Title  
VII would be at war with itself.  See id., at 89 (argument of 
Solicitor General) (such an approach would be “giving effect
to religious hostility”); contra, EEOC v. Sambo’s of Georgia, 
Inc., 530 F. Supp. 86, 89 (ND Ga. 1981) (considering as 
hardship “[a]dverse customer reaction” from “a simple aver-
sion to, or discomfort in dealing with, bearded people”). 
  Second, as the Solicitor General’s authorities underscore,  
Title VII requires that an employer reasonably accommo-
date an employee’s practice of religion, not merely that it 
assess the reasonableness of a particular possible accommo-
dation or accommodations.  See Adeyeye, 721 F. 3d, at 455;  
see also Brief for United States 30, 33, 39.  This distinction 
matters.  Faced  with  an  accommodation  request  like
Groff’s, it would not be enough for an employer to conclude 
 
that forcing other employees to work overtime would con-
stitute an undue hardship.  Consideration of other options,
such as voluntary shift swapping, would also be necessary.

Opinion of the Court 
IV 
  Having clarified the Title VII undue-hardship standard, 
we think it appropriate to leave the context-specific appli-
cation of that clarified standard to the lower courts in the 
first instance.  The Third Circuit assumed that Hardison  
prescribed a “more than a de minimis cost” test, 35 F. 4th, 
at 175, and this may have led the court to dismiss a number
of possible accommodations, including those involving the 
cost of incentive pay, or the administrative costs of coordi-
nation with other nearby stations with a broader set of em-
ployees. Without foreclosing the possibility that USPS will 
prevail, we think it appropriate to leave it to the lower 
courts to apply our clarified context-specific standard, and 
to  decide  whether  any  further  factual  development  is  
needed.

GERALD E. GROFF, PETITIONER v.  
LOUIS DEJOY, POSTMASTER GENERAL  
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF 
APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT  
[June 29, 2023] 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE JACKSON joins,
concurring.  
  As both parties here agree, the phrase “more than a de 
minimis cost” from Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison, 
432 U. S. 63, 84 (1977), was loose language.  An employer
violates Title VII if it fails “to reasonably accommodate” an 
employee’s religious observance or practice, unless the em-
ployer demonstrates that accommodation would result in 
“undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business.”  
42 U. S. C. §2000e(j).  The statutory standard is “undue 
hardship,” not trivial cost. 
  Hardison, however, cannot be reduced to its “de minimis” 
language. Instead, that case must be understood in light of 
its facts and the Court’s reasoning.  The Hardison  Court  
concluded  that  the  plaintiff ’s  proposed  accommodation 
 
would have imposed an undue hardship on the conduct of 
the employer’s business because the accommodation would
have required the employer either to deprive other employ-
ees of their seniority rights under a collective-bargaining
agreement, or to incur substantial additional costs in the 
form of lost efficiency or higher wages.  432 U. S., at 79–81, 
83–84, and n. 14.  The Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission  has  interpreted  Title  VII’s  undue-hardship 
standard in this way for seven consecutive Presidential ad-
ministrations, from President Reagan to President Biden.

SOTOMAYOR,  J., concurring  
See 29 CFR §1605.2(e) (2022) (citing Hardison, 432 U. S.,  
at 80, 84).
  Petitioner Gerald Groff asks this Court to overrule Har-
dison and to replace it with a “significant difficulty or ex-
pense” standard.  Brief for Petitioner 17–38.  The Court 
does not do so.  That is a wise choice because stare decisis  
has “enhanced force” in statutory cases.  Kimble v.  Marvel 
Entertainment, LLC, 576 U. S. 446, 456 (2015).  Congress is 
free to revise this Court’s statutory interpretations.  The 
Court’s respect for Congress’s decision not to intervene pro-
motes the separation of powers by requiring interested par-
ties to resort to the legislative rather than the judicial pro-
cess to achieve their policy goals.  This justification for 
statutory stare decisis is especially strong here because 
“Congress has spurned multiple opportunities to reverse 
[Hardison]—openings as frequent and clear as this Court
ever sees.” Id., at 456–457.1 Moreover, in the decades since 
Hardison was decided,  Congress has revised Title VII mul-
tiple times in response to other decisions of this Court,2 yet 
never in response to Hardison.  See Kimble, 576 U. S., at 
457.

  Groff also asks the Court to decide that Title VII requires 
the United States Postal Service to show “undue hardship
to [its] business,” not to Groff ’s co-workers.  Brief for Peti-
 
tioner 42 (emphasis added); see 35 F. 4th 162, 176 (CA3 
2022) (Hardiman, J., dissenting). The Court, however, rec-
ognizes that Title VII requires “undue hardship on the con-
duct of the employer’s business.” 42 U. S. C. §2000e(j) (em-
phasis added). Because the “conduct of [a] business” plainly
includes the management and performance of the busi-
ness’s employees, undue hardship on the conduct of a busi-
ness may include undue hardship on the business’s employ-
ees. See, e.g., Hardison, 432 U. S., at 79–81 (deprivation of 
employees’ bargained-for seniority rights constitutes undue 
hardship).  There is no basis in the text of the statute, let 
alone in economics or common sense, to conclude otherwise.  
Indeed, for many businesses, labor is more important to the 
conduct of the business than any other factor. 
  To be sure, some effects on co-workers will not constitute  
“undue hardship” under Title VII.  For example, animus to-
ward a protected group is not a cognizable “hardship” under 
any antidiscrimination statute. Cf. ante, at 20. In addition,  
some hardships, such as the labor costs of coordinating vol-
untary shift swaps, are not “undue” because they are too
insubstantial.  See 29 CFR §§1605.2(d)(1)(i), (e)(1).  Never-
theless, if there is an undue hardship on “the conduct of the 
employer’s business,” 42 U. S. C. §2000e(j), then such hard-
ship is sufficient, even if it consists of hardship on employ-
ees.  With these observations, I join the opinion of the 
Court.
